<p>Meeting Date/Time: 11 17 2021, 6:30 P.M.</p>
<p>These meeting minutes were approved at the January 20222 meeting.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-notes">Attendance Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directors Present: Melanie Davies, Mike Cuadra, Bekah Gautrowski, Bob Blade, Lindsey Webb, Kathleen Braden, Liz Kearns</li>
<li>General Members Present: Shaun Vinyard, Kevin Sheets, Diego Gabrieli, Evelyn Lemon, Ellen Beck, Moses, Dianne Trani, Janice Holkup</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="welcome-introductions-and-hearing-from-neighbors">Welcome, Introductions, and Hearing from Neighbors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.</li>
<li>Shaun Vinyard moved to Licton Springs from Wedgwood and wants to get more familiar with issues in the Licton Springs neighborhood.</li>
<li>Evelyn Lemon asked whether a psychiatric hospital is being built in the neighborhood? Bekah shared that a private company is building a senior inpatient and family center. Melanie shared that there is supportive services and housing at 96th and Aurora. Shaun shared that UW is building an inpatient psychiatric hospital currently and thinks it will be a great addition to mental health care in the greater Seattle area.</li>
<li>Janice Holkup noted that apartments are going to be demolished across from the playfield near the school.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licton-springs-park">Licton Springs Park</h3>
<ul>
<li>In her capacity as park steward at Licton Springs Park, Liz gave an update on the park. 300 plants were recently delivered and the volunteer team can use all the help they can get in placing/planting them. There are work parties going on every month. [LW note: those meetings are noted on the calendar on the LSCC website]. </li>
<li>Regarding the comfort station (restrooms), Liz said there was an insurance investigator there one day when she was at the park and a Seattle Parks &amp; Recreation employee unlocked the fence. Both said the fire was the result of arson. The city’s insurance was for $200,000 and that may end up being the cost to rebuild.</li>
<li>Liz asked the insurance investigator and the Parks &amp; Rec employee if they could save anything from the building. However, the fire was so intense that it compromised the integrity of the metal so the answer was no. Liz said it would be nice to be able to store tools in the new structure but for $200,000 it might be difficult. </li>
<li>Melanie suggested that Parks &amp; Rec staff may be looking for additional funds for the structure. She volunteered to write a letter to Parks (with Liz’s help) outlining how the facility has been used and what we would like. Mike said it never hurts to get letters of support, and maybe it would be a good avenue to get tribal support. Kathleen talked about the Muckleshoot tribe’s charitable fund and how the council could apply for $5,000 from that fund for educational signage for when the facility gets rebuilt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="halloween-recap">Halloween Recap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bekah said the Halloween decorating raffle and neighborhood map were very well received across the neighborhood and there were many participants. The digital map was viewed 2,776 times. There was a motion to approve $45 from the LSCC account to cover part of the raffle prize that were not donated. The motion passed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="north-precinct-meeting">North Precinct Meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike Cuadra gave a summary of the last North Precinct meeting. Nicole Macri of the Downtown Emergency Service Center talked about emergency services. DESC recently purchased two hotels to provide permanent supportive housing services. Lindsey asked about whethere P2P meth had ever been discussed at these meetings and whether it’s been part of the homelessness issue in Seattle. Mike said it has been discussed and it is a problem here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arts-in-the-park-funding">Arts in the Park Funding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lindsey talked about the open funding opportunity for Arts in the Park funding and suggested partnering with Boundless NW on an event next summer. She said she would submit an application for funding for a neighborhood concert and would get in touch with Rob from Boundless NW to discuss.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="art-selection-committee">Art Selection Committee</h3>
<ul>
<li>LSCC has the opportunity to nominate someone on the art selection committee for the fire station on Meridian. There was a motion to nominate Bekah Gautrowski and the motion passed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-laws-committee">By-Laws Committee</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a discussion about how the council forms the agenda and how that should be reflected in the by-laws. Directors also discussed allowing a consent agenda (there was wide approval) and what constitutes appropriate notice for upcoming meetings.</li>

<h3 id="welcome-introductions">Welcome &amp; Introductions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="housing-at-north-seattle-college">Housing at North Seattle College</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leaders from Chief Seattle Club (CSC), Bellwether Housing (BH), North Seattle College (NSC), and architects for the planned affordable housing at North Seattle College talked about various aspects of the project and answered questions from residents. The project will include about 200 housing units with a target population of those earning up to 60% of the Area Median Income, especially those in the low wage workforce. Expected completion is in late 2024 and expected opening in early 2025.</li>
<li>Gregory Hinton of NSC gave a short summary of the original Request for Proposals.</li>
<li>Derrick Belgrade, Executive Director of CSC, talked about the org’s mission of tackling issues for Native Americans and low income individuals and families. CSC mainly provides social services but recently expanded into real estate and housing. They are excited to build housing for families and foster community, health, and well-being with this project, including the longhouse.</li>
<li>Susan Boyd, CEO of BH, talked about the target population for the project. In addition to people with low incomes, outreach will focus on younger households and Native American households. Almost half of the units are 2- and 3-bedroom.</li>
<li>Jim Bodoia, an architect for the project, talked about the location, which is on the SE corner of the NSC property. It is close to parks, schools, and new transit development. The property has interesting topography and exceptional trees. Some of the trees will be removed, some retained. The city does not require saving trees if it hinders development potential of a site. Asked whether the project will affect nearby wetlands, he said it is well outside of the protected boundary.</li>
<li>The project is organized around four courtyards, each with its own character and purpose. An underground garage will have spaces for about 80 cars. The longhouse will be on the north part of the property due to the location of significant trees. At the south part of the property, there will be a natural amphitheater. Two housing buildings will be connected by a raised open air bridge. There will be a playground on the east side. Asked whether the project will impact the P-Patch, he said there is a study underway.</li>
<li>Architect JohnPaul Jones noted that the building is open to the street, which makes the development more pleasing for neighbors and allows sun and air into the development to the benefit of the residents. Current zoning allows the project as planned. Modeled after traditional longhouses, the longhouse on the property will seat 150-200 people indoors and can also host outdoor gatherings. The goal is to create inviting spaces to help native and non-native communities enjoy it.</li>
<li>There will be an opportunity to comment on the design during a second review process as the design progresses. Information on opportunities will be public. Residents within 300 feet of the site will get a notice in the mail about review.</li>
<li>Terrence from NSC talked about expected student enrollment in the coming years. The college anticipates students returning to campus after the pandemic but not at historical levels, in part because of increased hybrid course options. When this project is finished, the number of students will be lower. In past years the college has considered student housing with a focus on international students. However, there has been a drastic reduction in these students coming to campus so there isn’t enough demand to justify it.</li>
<li>Residents of Licton Springs and anyone else who is interested can go to https://www.bellwetherhousing.org/northseattlecollege for information on the project and email NSChousing@bellwetherhousing.org with questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licton-springs-park-restroom-update">Licton Springs Park Restroom Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike shared that the folks in Seattle Parks &amp; Rec working on this will be getting a demo permit for the comfort station and are working on a design and permitting to rebuild. Liz’s email to Kathleen said the architect on the project told her it will be rebuilt on a timeline of 2-3 years, pending asbestos and lead testing. There will be an opportunity for public comment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-councils-meeting-on-homelessness">Community Councils Meeting on Homelessness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several LSCC board members attended a meeting of north Seattle community councils convened by Blair Perilman of the Greenlake Community Council. Reps from different community councils attended for a discussion on actions community councils can take collectively to spur the city into more urgent action on the loss of open space due to encampments. </li>
<li>There was a discussion about the demise of district councils and whether the City Council would appreciate hearing from the community councils. Melanie said at the meeting there was a consensus about putting together a letter asking the city to let community groups know what is going on and what will happen moving forward since there is a lack of information coming out to local groups (contrary to what was planned under the Murray administration to keep local groups more informed). It is probably wise to hold off on a letter until after elections.</li>
<li>Kathleen sent Blair a list of block captains in the north precinct and people she knew were interested in a revised version of district councils. She also pointed out that there are tools that have been developed internally at the city to help address diversity issues. She wondered whether the city could share those tools with neighborhoods so we can work on expanding and diversifying the voices being heard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licton-springs-halloween">Licton Springs Halloween</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bekah is heading up the creation of the trick-or-treat and decorated home map for the neighborhood and said she would release the first draft on Saturday. Submissions for inclusion on the map would be accepted until midnight that day. There was a discussion of a raffle prize for home decorating. Bekah will approach local businesses for small gift cards to put together as a prize. The group discussed a potential allowance from the LSCC account should there be low interest from businesses in donating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aurora-reimagined-coalition">Aurora Reimagined Coalition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie attended the coalition’s last meeting, which included a discussion about the Safe Routes to Schools program. Right now there is a great need for crossing guards, but a major shortage in part because of harassment crossing guards endure here. Many crossing guards are also not comfortable working on Aurora because of the speed of cars there.</li>
<li>November 21 is a world day of remembrance for victims of traffic violence. There was a discussion at the coalition meeting about closing lanes at 100th and putting up tables, etc. to remember victims of traffic accidents. Melanie will find out more because there are potential opportunities to volunteer/participate.</li>
<li>The coalition is getting a lot of conversations going with various stakeholders in advance of SDOT’s deadline early next year to initiate a study of Aurora.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report">Approval of Minutes &amp; Treasurer's Report</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minutes from the September meeting and the Treasurer’s Report were approved. Bekah asked if the tools purchase noted on the Treasurer’s Report was due to loss because of the fire at the park restrooms but Liz was not available to answer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-laws-committee-update">By-Laws Committee Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a discussion of officer election and nomination procedures, and who should be considered a voting member at LSCC meetings. Lindsey said in order to make every attendee a voting member, the structure of how the council runs would need to change because by and large, board members are the only people consistently attending the meetings. No one had any major changes to the nomination or election process. Bekah said in most similar groups, the board elects the officers.</li>
<li>Bekah emailed each officer with the current description of their position and asked them to note any changes they would like to see.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors">Hearing from Neighbors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Neighborhood resident Fernando Cervantes brought up an improperly posted notice of a property change near his home having to do with removing trees. The process seemed shady as if the people in charge of the project wanted to sidestep the comment process. He had concerns with the design review process being very fast.</li>
<li>Comment in chat from Robin Amadon: I would like to see a community organization unity around linking all the new units being built and bought for our homeless neighbors with the specific concentrations of outdoor neighbors. I am not seeing this connection…so that the homeless cohorts get outreach and the chance to move into the various homeless housing options that are advancing and available to occupy.  For example, there is a new 65 unit project finishing at 81st and Greenwood by Inland Construction selling to Catholic Communit Services of Western Washington. As far as I have  hear, there has been NO outreach by CCS TO the Greenlake/Woodland Park homeless neighbors to get permanent and affordable housing.  This seems a shame—the silos need to cooperate to show an improvement.  The city is just backing away because the problem has been allowed to grow so large in scale.</li>

                <h2 id="licton-springs-community-council">LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</h2>
<p>Meeting Date/Time: September 15, 6:30 P.M.</p>
<p>These meeting minutes were approved at the October 2021 meeting.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-notes">Attendance Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directors Present: Melanie Davies, Mike Cuadra, Liz Kearns, Bekah Gautrowski, Bob Blade, Lindsey Webb, Kathleen Braden</li>
<li>General Members Present: Dianne Trani, Mary Katka, Martha Ware, Johnna Reitz, Jamie Waldock, Moses, Allan</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. </li>
<li>Attendees introduced themselves. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-visitors">Hearing from Neighbors &amp; Visitors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees. Martha said she was interested in hearing more about plans for Halloween in the neighborhood. Moses was interested in learning more about the council.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report">Approval of Minutes &amp; Treasurer's Report</h3>
<ul>
<li>The minutes and Treasurer’s Report were approved. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization-for-afghan-refugee-resettlement">Organization for Afghan Refugee Resettlement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen requested this agenda item but by the time of the meeting, World Relief was no longer putting together resettlement kits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion-about-halloween-event">Discussion about Halloween Event</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a discussion on how to move forward with a Halloween event this year given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Melanie gave a history of the event, which has been a trick-or-treat event in Licton Springs Park with “stations” where volunteers hand out candy and cider to attendees. There have also been musicians in the past.</li>
<li>Bob suggested that we make a call on whether to hold the event a week ahead of time. However, Melanie said she would need more time to organize volunteers.</li>
<li>The group discussed alternative locations or confining it to one half of the park, given that there are people living in the park currently. Kathleen noted the charm of the event has been in its being spread across the whole park. Alternative potential locations were at one of the two schools on 90th, Mineral Springs Park, North Seattle College, or on the new pedestrian bridge. Lindsey will reach out to relevant contacts about the two latter locations. Residents near Mineral Springs Park pointed out the difficulty with parking in that area and historically holding meetings at Cascadia Elementary has been challenging.</li>
<li>Bekah suggested a house decorating contest and house-to-house trick-or-treating with an associated map that could be distributed to residents. The event could include a prize. Melanie moved to give Bekah the go-ahead to start planning that, regardless of whether there is an in-person event. Bob seconded and the motion passed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="response-to-fire-in-licton-springs-park">Response to Fire in Licton Springs Park</h3>
<ul>
<li>Liz relayed information to the group about the fire. It happened on Saturday, September 4th. Residents across the street from the park were awoken at 4:30am, hearing glass breaking. The restroom was fully engulfed in flames. No one was hurt. No one had information about who was responsible for the fire. Seattle Parks has said informally that the structure will need to be taken down and will cost $150k to replace. Liz has not been able to get any official information however. The department has brought in two porta-potties.</li>
<li>There was a discussion of statements/letters about the fire from LSCC to volunteers and other interested parties. Kathleen suggested that Liz express condolences to volunteers and that LSCC express sadness and concern to the Native American communities who just celebrated the historic status of the park. Kathleen also wanted to reiterate questions to Councilmember Juarez about plans to investigate and rebuild. She said she would reach out to UNEA as well as the landmarks board to find out whether the park’s historic landmark status will impact where it fits in the queue of parks projects to be completed. She noted that whoever burned the restroom facility also violated the city ordinance on destruction of places of historical/cultural significance.</li>
<li>Kathleen will draft a letter to Councilmember Juarez’ office inquiring about any investigation. Mike suggested that the council should be thinking about going to the Park Oversight Committee and be in contact with the park commissioners (longer-term). Mike said he would talk to his contacts in constructions at the Parks department about who to talk to there.</li>
<li>Liz asked about tribal involvement in getting the structure rebuilt. Bekah said this should be the City’s responsibility and the City has not given us tools to fix problems in the park.  Kathleen took photos and sent them to the Seattle Times, but thus far there hasn’t been media coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pillings-pond">Pillings Pond</h3>
<ul>
<li>Liz contacted the owner of the Pillings Pond property and the adjacent house to find more about what’s going on there currently. They are looking for someone to rent the house. This would be at a reduced rate, but the renters are also responsible for feeding the ducks in the morning and evening. The person next door and a few other people are volunteering while the owner looks for new renters.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-laws-committee">By-Laws Committee</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bekah will send a by-laws related email by the end of the month. Board members should look through the discussion questions. She expects the by-laws review/revision process to be complete by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lscc-history">LSCC History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie and Mary gave a summary of the history of the Licton Springs Community Council for new attendees. LSCC’s main goals include making neighborhood resident voices heard and trying to connect people to information on issues they care about that are relevant to the neighborhood.</li>

<h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report">Approval of Minutes &amp; Treasurer's Report</h3>
<ul>
<li>The minutes and Treasurer’s Report were approved. Bekah asked for clarification on what was meant in the Treasurer’s Report by “Ending Balance reflects $10.00 held in PayPal account.” Liz explained that Kevin Sheets made a $10.00 donation to LSCC via PayPal and that she is working on getting the balance transferred to the LSCC bank account.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-visitors">Hearing from Neighbors &amp; Visitors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees but there were none at that time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-play-street">Potential Play Street</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bekah talked about the possibility of a closed play street sometime this summer, likely on Densmore. She said the permit process through the city is not complicated and the cost is low. There was a discussion about whether to have this as a separate event as the music in the park event Lindsey is working on, the group decided a separate event would be better so as not to take attention away from any musical performance. Bekah will take the lead on planning this for sometime in August and will provide information to the Board of Directors via email or at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music-in-the-park-update">Music in the Park Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lindsey has been corresponding with Boundless NW about planning a Music in the Park event at Licton Springs Park in either July or August. Rob with Boundless NW has been in touch with the City of Seattle about permits, and it shouldn’t be a heavy lift in that respect. Rob’s suggestion is to have centralized music with a small stage. Lindsey will keep the group updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="by-laws-committee-update">By-laws Committee Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bekah let everyone know the By-Laws Committee, an ad hoc committee that is working on updating LSCC’s by-laws, will meet on June 29th at 7:00pm via Zoom. Anyone is welcome to join this meeting.

Meeting ID: 822 4817 4726
Passcode: 335608</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="northgate-pedestrian-bridge-update">Northgate Pedestrian Bridge Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lindsey let the group know the section of the bridge over northbound I-5 has been installed and this coming weekend southbound I-5 will be closed and cars will be rerouted so the other section can be installed. More information at SDOT’s website here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="north-seattle-college-presidents-advisory-board-update">North Seattle College President's Advisory Board Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lindsey is now the LSCC representative to the NSC President’s Advisory Board update. The meeting in May included introductions of NSC leadership and advisory board members, NSC actions to address COVID-19, and an update on the upcoming Bellwether Housing project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="greenlake-community-center-update">Greenlake Community Center Update</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike gave a status report on the Green Lake Community Center. The center is in the design and feasibility stage and leaders are currently applying for city landmark status. The boiler update is complete. The Green Lake Advisory Council is advocating for $5,000,000 to complete design and permitting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guests-for-future-meetings">Guests for Future Meetings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melanie asked if we could consider having a guest from Bellwether Housing present at the next meeting. Lindsey added that a guest from the Aurora Reimagined Coalition would be good also. Lindsey will reach out to Bellwether and Melanie will reach out to Aurora Commons for a contact at Aurora Reimagined.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="north-precinct-report">North Precinct Report</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mike gave an update on a few matters related to the North Precinct. He said crimes are up in the north end, particularly robberies and assault. There was a discussion about theft of catalytic converters on cars, based on stories attendees had heard from other areas. Mike is going to ask for any information on this at the next North Precinct update meeting.</li>
<li>There was a question of whether prostitution is happening at a higher level right now. Mike pointed out that this is, in many cases, human trafficking. Melanie asked if the issue would be worth reaching out to City Council about to see what the city is doing to address this. Bekah mentioned that with the upcoming hot summer, it would be great for residents to share water and extra masks with sex workers on Aurora if they see a need. Janice Holkup said Aurora Commons provides services to folks in the area but that their long-time Executive Director is leaving.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licton-springs-park-activity">Licton Springs Park Activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Community member Nina asked what the best course of action is if there is suspicious or dangerous activity going on in the park (for example, a resident of the park burning plastic materials). Liz suggested using the Find It Fix It app and also calling the fire department, as they are familiar with the person who is doing this. Nina asked if background checks are ever conducted for folks living in the park given proximity to kids. Kathleen talked about her positive experience with SPD’s community service officer - this is different from typical police activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-licton-springs-park-signage">New Licton Springs Park Signage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matt Remle is planning a celebration to dedicate new Licton Springs park signage later this summer and the council will likely be invited to attend (but not have a speaking role). There will be a rock etching installed leading to the spring head. Liz will talk to Matt about particulars and get back to us. There was a discussion about gift giving at the event, as this is important in many indigenous cultures. Community member attendee Nina has a friend who may be able to provide insight on appropriate gifts. Lindsey will connect with Nina separately on this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="halloween-event">Halloween Event</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen asked about whether the council would like to start planning a Halloween event. Other board members agreed that waiting until September to take the temperature on the pandemic situation, etc. would be fine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meeting-format">Meeting Format</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lindsey inquired as to whether the council would be open to discussing in-person meetings again. Other members agreed it would be fine to table until the September meeting, but one option is to have quarterly meetings in person and others would be virtual, as it’s easier for many people to attend this way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="halloween-celebration">Halloween Celebration</h3>
<p>There was a discussion about a potential Halloween event but the topic was informally tabled as it’s several months away and the COVID-19 situation could be different then.</p>
<h3 id="housing-in-licton-springs">Housing in Licton Springs</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a discussion about rising housing prices and how they will affect Licton Springs residents. Melanie mentioned the Community Land Trust, which is an organization that buys property in various ways for the purpose of providing housing to people like teachers, police, firefighters, and other essential workers who may not be able to purchase or rent a home at market rate in the area. She encouraged attendees to refer people with affordability concerns to the Community Land Trust. Janice Holkup mentioned there will be another tiny house village going up in north Seattle soon.</li>
