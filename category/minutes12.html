                <p>NOTES FROM SEPT 28, 2019 RETREAT LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</p>
<p>10 AM – 12 PM at Meridian Center for Health, Seattle</p>
<p>Notetaker: Kathleen Braden, Secretary</p>
<p>All Board members present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Thomas Stachiw, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Amanda Culp-Crosley, Timothy Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Members thanked Janice for her organization and the room decorations to get us in a productive mood!  Various members brought in food and beverages.</p>
<p>Janice distributed documents including an agenda and time allocation for each item to keep us on track. She welcomed everyone and explained the plan for the retreat. Board members reviewed accomplishments for 2018-19.</p>
<p>Members were then invited to state what they felt priorities should be for 2019-20 and Melanie Davies noted items on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>The group then reviewed some operational guidelines for how the discussion would proceed.  Janice created a “Parking Lot” space for the whiteboard for items that occur to members but that we would park for subsequent discussion.</p>
<p>The group reviewed data on LSCC activities and some population profile data based on 1990 and 2010 Censuses to get an idea of distinctives of Licton Springs neighborhood.</p>
<p>Ellen Beck gave a Treasurer’s report and the group discussed ideas on financial side (more fundraising, more equipment, more events, paying for a newsletter editor and distribution, grants to reflect our diverse community, Arts in the Park, visit-consult with Mark mendez of Lake City.</p>
<p>Janice brought up the manner in which we take donations and payment of dues.  Amanda noted Amazon Smile and Janice and Ellen are going to verify that we are set for that  Kathleen will check on access to Paypal account.</p>
<p>Janice noted her hope that we will create both a fundraising committee and a marketing-outreach committee and that we not miss the chance for some items we might sell such as tee shirts or bumper stickers. She noted such committees do not need to be just Board members but we could recruit members of the community who might be willing to serve.</p>
<p>Amanda discussed how we might use existing funds we have in our account.  Melanie noted the City’s fundraising workshops for community activists.</p>
<p>Other issues that were brought up included relations with schools in area, including North Seattle College, parking issue sin neighborhood, historic status of Licton Springs park and surrounding neighborhood, more on fundraising, and business relations, particularly with advent of NORA (North Aurora Business, a brainchild of Epic Life Church). Jan noted the passing of Faye Garneau and she will be sending a message of condolence on behalf of the council, pointing out Faye’s contribution to citizen activism as a business owner in the area.  Jan also underscored her interest that the Council start a system to have recognition of people/organizations who have made a positive impact on Licton Springs.</p>
<p>Board members then engaged in a prioritization process and various people agreed to be point people on the priorities as follows:</p>
<p>Janice—School relations</p>
<p>Liz- Licton Springs historic status (park, neighborhood)</p>
<p>Melanie- representing LSCC to other meetings and organizations</p>
<p>Kathleen &amp; Thomas- Recruiting more Board members</p>
<p>Amanda- Events</p>
<p>Tim- engagement &amp; efficiency for monthly meetings</p>

<p>Directors present: Thomas Stachiw, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Amanda Crosley, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introductions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minutes Jan. 16 , 2019 were approved as distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letter from Tim Motzer to Debora Juarez from Lake City Neighborhood Alliance (attached) asking for the Council's endorsement. Directors discussed it and had questions about the fee structure and asked Kathleen to send note to Tim declining but that we hope in the future to have a discussion on MHA and fees with other community groups such as LCNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As FYI, Kathleen provided map of MHA zooning proposals and list of amendments that are up for vote in March by City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion of Handy Andy business on Aurora.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda brought up Your Voice Your Choice request for proposals deadline approaching Feb 22 and the Neighborhood Street Fund program with votes due soon on proposals for Licton Springs and adjacent areas  Kathleen will send out to listserv remainder for people to go online and vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group discussed various techniques used by SDOT and DON that creates competition and even "popularity contests" among competing projects proposed by citizens.  Melanie suggested a letter about District Five being poorer than other districts in terms of sidewalks. Kathleen updated the group on proposal to improve signage in Licton Springs Park and her frustration with DON processes when this should merely be part of regular Parks maintenance schedule. She noted her intention to cease efforts to make a DON large grants proposal and will inform the d-hoc committee brought together in the fall, as well as PNA who had agreed to serve as sponsor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Amanda noted we did not get picked for the Arts in the Park projects and will explore other possibilities.  She will be looking into various grant options like Small Sparks and Neighborhood Matching Funds.  Kathleen suggested that any money LSCC had agreed to set aside from our parks fund for signage in Licton Springs Park might be redirected as matching seed money for the Arts or event projects Amanda is thinking of.</p>
<p>Melanie noted that Epic Life Church might do another Celebrate North Seattle event. It might be good to invite someone from the church to our next meeting. She also discussed ALUV efforts to do a zoning change from commercial to neighborhood-commercial.</p>
<p>We discussed the Home Zone project, SDOT, data on traffic measurement and Ed Irwin applying for speed bumps for traffic calming.</p>
<p>Melanie noted the Aurora pedestrian bridge artwork is now up and the daffodils planted there will soon be blooming.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that City Council District Five candidate John Lombard had indicated a desire to be at one of our meetings and the group noted he is welcome to come and listen but we have not had a tradition of inviting candidates in for their campaign promotions.  Kathleen will email him.</p>

He noted that the Duwamish people have been in the area for 15,000years because tribal traditions date back to the Ice Age.

The current plan for the North Precinct building was discussed. She noted the LEAD program (Law Enforcement Aided Diversion) is coming to the precinct and officers are in training now. More officer shave been budgeted for patrols around the Aurora Encampment. She provided "Smart 911" cards from King County for people who might want their information to be recorded since there is currently not a way for an exact location to be tracked just from a cell phone. <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx">https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx</a></p>
<p>Mary noted that one can call the North Precinct and put in a "request to watch" for neighborhood or house and, provided the officer has time, it will be done on a regular basis.  She noted that King County keeps the sex registry and a map for the Licton Springs neighborhood can be seen online [https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/sheriff/sex-offender-search.aspx]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Licton Springs Web Page</span>- Timothy showed us the proposed new web page for the Licton Springs Community Council which includes archived existing page.  He and Amanda had also scanned in old copies of <em>Currents</em> and added a link, as well as a link to the North Precinct, things to do in the neighborhood, green space, discussion page, community calendar, and many other features.  The Licton Springs Community Council members complimented Tim &amp; Amanda on it. M/S/A to commission Tim to go ahead with it and Kathleen will put him in contact with Lisa Henry to get codes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lee Bruch on Aurora Coalition, D5 plans-</span> The May 31 forum sponsored by D5 with at-large City Council representatives went well, with about 150 people attending. In July, there will be vehicle-tours of District Five neighborhoods with Mosqueda and González over a two day period, July 27 (Northgate and Lake City) and July 31 (Licton Springs, Haller Lake, Bitter Lake).  Lee called for docents to help with the tour and make presentations at various stops, as well as assistance with handouts. Both ALUV and Licton Springs should participate. Jan suggested Liz for the park and discussed issues related to City Light land.</p>
<p>The group then discussed concerns about plans for the North Precinct police station (portables, new parking area).</p>
<p>The meeting was adjourned at 8:40 PM.  Notes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary</p>
<p>Next meeting July 18, 2018</p>
