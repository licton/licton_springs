                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Meeting Date/Time: Nov. 18, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>These meeting minutes were approved at the January 2021 meeting.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Liz Kearns, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Dianne Trani, Tracy Cramer, Mike Cuadra, Emma Medicine White Crow, Bekah Manikowski (Gautrowski) and Matt, Peter Reid, Becky Edmonds, Jenny Frankl</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  </p>
<p>Minutes of Oct 21, 2020 were approved as circulated.  Treasurer’s Report was approved. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Issues of interest from Visitors: Jenny Frankl of SPU Clean Cities Litter Abatement shared information on litter route for Licton Springs. (attached).  Liz noted a work party upcoming Dec. 12 for Licton Springs Park with volnteers from Blanchet H.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky Edmonds made a presentation on Restricted Parking Zone and other parking issues in Licton Springs area. (study map below). If the RPZ is expanded (there is an existing one due to NSCollege) with upcoming transportation changes, cost is $65/year for two year cycle.  Low income people have an option of paying $10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenny discussed the litter abatement program that started in 2017 in the city and in 2018 in Licton Springs-Aurora area.  A contractor is paid to cover Aurora between 84th and 105th.  Parks Dept deals with parks so that is not part of their program.  The volume of calls has not increased, but the volume of litter picked up has. The public cans along Aurora havea four times/week pick up for garbage and three times per week for recycling. Tracy suggested using free form at bottom of Find It Fix It app for special pickups for neighbors who voluntarily pick up litter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board elections for 2021 were discussed. Our usual schedule for elections had been postponed last spring due to pandemic.  Nominations are due in March.  Let Kathleen know if Board members are interested in serving again.  She will construct a recruitment statement for Dianne Trani from jet City Apts. to sed to residents to try to get representaiton from renters in neighborhood.  Everyone wil try to recruit people, with an eye toward more divesity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are unable to do holiday party and Epic Life Church is not planning lights in Licton Springs Park this year but Ellen noted there will b e a tree on the Burke cul-de-sac</p>
</li>

<p>1, Group discussed letter from ALUV sent to Geoffrey Wendtland January of this year to Office of Planning and Community Development. Ryan DiRaimo had emailed it to LSCC October 7 to keep us informed. It appears many planning projects are on hold due to disruptions caused by current COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LSCC and UNEA/Clear Sky relations and purchase of tee-shirts to thank the UNEA youth.  melanie has already received orders and M/S/A to spend up to $500 for the shirts.  Liz attended the Sept 30 UNEA virtual meeting and noted once the pandemic is over, there might be volunteer opportunities with UNEA, for example, tutoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melanie invited visitors to address us. Tracy Cramer Clean City Division City of Seattle discussed community cleanup efforts, such as one for November, ate TBD. She also introduced us to Jenny Frankl, Sr Planning &amp; Development Specialist Public Place Littering &amp; Recycling Program, Clean City Division. Tracy and the group discussed clean up in the parks and neighborhood, particularly given recent City decisions on homeless encampmens.  Liz noted the Parks Dept would be doing a cleanup in Licton Springs Park Oct 22. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dianne Trani attended and noted her boss, Brian Robinson, a local property owner with various rental properties and a commitment to affordable housing and helping on neighborhood issues, would love to hear from LSCC on ways he could be of assistance.  Lindsey requested some help contacting renters who might be interested in joining us to add a diverse voice to the Council and help with outreach. </p>
<p>Osbaldo Hernandez from DON has replaced the retired Thomas Whittemore and introduced himself. He noted that community conversations has been initiated, with the next scheduled for Nov 18, probably on the topic of public safety. http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/outreach-and-engagement/community-conversations </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Several LSCC members attended the recent virtual town hall  held by Debra Juarez and reported on the budget presentation, looking on our screens at the Powerpoint slides (Ben Noble, Dean Allsopp) indicating some real shortfalls in revenue to the City that are necessitating putting many activities on hold, such as moving ahead for now with the feasibility study for an Aurora-Licton Community Center. Melanie also reported on the group discussing public safety (Indian Health Board and Community Police Commission, Esther Lucero and Ryan Gilbert) and Jason Johnson for City Human Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group considered a request from Board member Amanda Crosley for support for North Seattle College Co-Op Preschool (see Oct 19 email from Amanda). The Board authorized a $150 donation and Janice will get in touch with Amanda and request preference for the donation to go to local area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janice is still following up with Restricted Parking issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We affirmed that we cannot hold our holiday event this year due to the pandemic and city restrictions on parks since we usually hold it in Mineral Springs Park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we plan to have an event to celebrate Jan Brucker’s years of service once we are able to hold events in person, for now, Kathleen and Ellen will deliver the recognition award to Jan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melanie reported on a Greenways meeting re Healthy Streets and Healthy Blocks initiatives and indicated there is still lack of clarity on all processes to designate streets or blocks as such. Healthy Streets are ones that had already been designated as Greenways but the blocks process not clear.</p>
