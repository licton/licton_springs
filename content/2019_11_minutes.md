Treasurer’s Report of Oct 16-Nov 20 2019 and minutes from October 16 2019 were approved with correction of typo.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Events and applications</span>: Amanda had completed the Arts in the Park application for a Dec. 21 event at Mineral Springs Park and LSCC was awarded the grant.  There will be a clothing drive, music, food, card making, and sugar plum elves. Entertainment and a port-a-potty will be provided and Amanda is currently in process of recruiting volunteers.  Kathleen will help Liz who is looking into finding another musician group.

Liz noted the Dec 7 lighting for Licton Springs park and the lights will be up until Jan 11.  Epic Life Church will have a small ceremony to turn on the lights and Liz noted that special care will be taken for the safety of the light hangers.  Liz will send Kathleen an announcement to post and to ask for LED light donations.

The group noted the summer movie program for Mineral Springs Park and the application that was submitted for a Native American celebration in Licton Springs Park in July (thank you Janice!).  We discussed whether we would need a business license from the City of Seattle and if it turns out we need it due to revenue amount, Janice will look into it.

Melanie reported on Halloween event and had emailed Kathleen the cost and donations summary:

Liz reminded us of the second-Saturday work parties in Licton Springs Park and the group noted the press coverage of the Landmarks Preservation Board action regarding Native American significance of the park (reported in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Seattle Times</span> and Crosscut). Liz said there will be 3-4 work parties coming up for Mineral Springs Park and while there have been some rough campers there, tent campers have not been observed.  The disk golf people also plan some work parties.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Online vote results</span>- the board voted by email to add the City of Seattle to our insurance coverage and to allocate $500 toward the matching grant portion of the application for the Native American summer celebration grant.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other business</span>- Amanda noted that the Parks Dept felt LSCC did not need a business license and will send Kathleen verification of that for the record.  She reported on our Paypal account to take donations and recommended transferring money to our bank account on a regular basis.

Kathleen will send out a reminder to people to fill out our survey.  Debora Juarez plans to attend our Jan. 15 meeting and we agreed we can send her the survey results ahead so she knows that issues are on the minds of Licton Springs residents.

Liz asked LSCC members as individuals to send letters of support for an effort by Thornton Creek Alliance to keep funding for Green Seattle Partnership in City budget.

Janice reported that Leah Anderson from ALUV was reaching out to local community council leaders for a get-together. Melanie, Liz, and Kathleen reported on a recent ReVisioning Northgate meeting.

Kathleen reminded people to send bios and pictures for our web page if they have not yet done so. Janice expressed early-Thanksgiving appreciation to members of the Board who in turn thanked her for serving as president.

This was Thomas’s last meeting as a member of the Board and he noted he had enjoyed serving and would help as he was able in the future. Thank you for your service, Thomas!

Janice closed the meeting at 8:30 PM.
