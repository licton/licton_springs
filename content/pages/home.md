# Welcome to the Licton Springs Community Council's website!

If you live, work, or conduct business in Licton Springs: the Community Council acts as your ally, advocate, and connector.
The council was formed in 1990 to:

```
Represent the interests of the residents and the
owners of commercial and professional businesses
in the Licton Springs Neighborhood of the City of
Seattle, Washington, to improve community welfare
and happiness, and to promote a quality of life
consonant with an urban, residential community
```

And continues that mission to this day.

To accomplish these goals we:

1. Provide a public forum for discussion through our public meetings held the third Wednesday of the month at 6:30pm at Meridian Center for Health.
2. Assume the role of official voice for the Licton Springs Neighborhood in dealing with public and private organizations.
3. Keep the community informed through contributions to [the neighborhood blog](https://lovelicton.com/), monthly meeting minutes, and our newsletter.
4. Join with other community organizations on issues of mutual concern.
5. Organize regular events to foster a deeper sense of community. You can see currently planned events on our [Community Calendar](/pages/community-calendar.html).
6. Pursue other appropriate activities that positively affect the welfare of the community.

# Bring a topic up for discussion
