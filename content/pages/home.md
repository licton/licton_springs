# Welcome to the Licton Springs Community Council's website!

If you live, work, or conduct business in Licton Springs: the Community Council acts as your ally, advocate, and connector.
The council was formed in 1990 to:

> Represent the interests of the residents and the
> owners of commercial and professional businesses
> in the Licton Springs Neighborhood of the City of
> Seattle, Washington, to improve community welfare
> and happiness, and to promote a quality of life
> consonant with an urban, residential community

And continues that mission to this day.

To accomplish these goals we:

1. Provide a public forum for discussion through our public meetings held the third Wednesday of the month at 6:30pm.
2. Assume the role of official voice for the Licton Springs Neighborhood in dealing with public and private organizations.
3. Keep the community informed through monthly meeting minutes and our newsletter.
4. Join with other community organizations on issues of mutual concern.
5. Organize regular events to foster a deeper sense of community. You can see currently planned events on our [Community Calendar](/pages/community-calendar.html).
