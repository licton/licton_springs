# Welcome to the Licton Springs Community Council's website!

If you live, work, or conduct business in Licton Springs: the Community Council acts as your ally, advocate, and connector.
The council was formed in 1990 to:

> Represent the interests of the residents and the
> owners of commercial and professional businesses
> in the Licton Springs Neighborhood of the City of
> Seattle, Washington, to improve community welfare
> and happiness, and to promote a quality of life
> consonant with an urban, residential community

And continues that mission to this day.

To accomplish these goals we:

1. Provide a public forum for discussion through our public meetings held the third Wednesday of the month at 6:30pm.
2. Assume the role of official voice for the Licton Springs Neighborhood in dealing with public and private organizations.
3. Keep the community informed through contributions to [the neighborhood blog](https://lovelicton.com/), monthly meeting minutes, and our newsletter.
4. Join with other community organizations on issues of mutual concern.
5. Organize regular events to foster a deeper sense of community. You can see currently planned events on our [Community Calendar](/pages/community-calendar.html).
6. Pursue other appropriate activities that positively affect the welfare of the community.

# Bring a topic up for discussion
