Amanda discussed how we might use existing funds we have in our account.  Melanie noted the City’s fundraising workshops for community activists.

Other issues that were brought up included relations with schools in area, including North Seattle College, parking issue sin neighborhood, historic status of Licton Springs park and surrounding neighborhood, more on fundraising, and business relations, particularly with advent of NORA (North Aurora Business, a brainchild of Epic Life Church).
