<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Communication recommendation approved</span>: during this time of COVID-19 Stay Home order from Governor Inslee, not make any major changes in manner of sending messages to our list serve, but continue to use free Outlook service.  Help was also offered to the Love Licton blog for material and Amanda and Tim are trying to keep it at very local level.  A lot of information is being pushed out right now by City, King County authorities. </p>
<p>Lindsey and her husband, Mehul, are walking each street of Licton Springs neighborhood and will do a write-up and send Amanda.  Mehul is interested in LSCC eventually doing a community survey on loneliness and isolation. </p>
<p>It was noted that neighborhood restaurants are open for takeout and it is a good way to support business owners locally. Lindsey will follow up with Hector Martinez at Epic Life church who is with the local Buy Nothing group as well and see if something can be written up for the blog.</p>
<p>Liz noted that the parks are closed so no work parties are now occurring. </p>
<p>Reminder that people should be filling out Census 2020 information.  Field operations have been moved till later due to virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Janice Holkup reminded people of Kathleen’s proposal that was on the table from the Feb 26 meeting.  She has attached it below for consideration at April meeting.</p>
<p>Janice L. gave an update on Arts in the Park and that she has been in contact with Sarah Sense Wilson of Clear Sky.  The event will be pushed out to late August or Sept. in part to wait for City to do final approval of historic status for the park. </p>
<p>Nominations for the Board and vote on approval will be moved to next September due to unusual circumstances of COVID 19 outbreak and to allow more time for recruiting new members.</p>
