&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Matt Gross and I am running to be your next state senator. I grew up in northeast Seattle and my wife Anna and I are raising our family in Maple Leaf. She is a public school teacher and I serve as a deputy prosecutor for King County. Our family wants to live in a clean, safe neighborhood. And we want everyone in our city to live in a clean, safe neighborhood. That’s my priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish that, our State government needs to ensure everyone has access to housing, mental health care and drug treatment regardless of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in individual accountability but I have no illusions that cracking down on crime is the best or only way to make us safer. Instead, we need to proactively invest in people's stability. That starts with guaranteeing access to affordable housing, mental healthcare and drug treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I knocked doors in Licton Springs a few months back, residents told me about the bathroom at the park. I saw it for myself and took this picture. I asked the parks department what the holdup was and they said they were waiting on a demolition permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image of Licton Springs Park bathroom after fire damaged the building beyond repair" src="/images/news/matt_gross_image_licton_springs_park_bathroom.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unacceptable for the city to just leave this standing next to a kid’s playground. Get out the bulldozer. As your Senator, I would use my voice to amplify the concerns of the residents of Licton Springs and make sure your concerns aren’t ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the son and grandson of farmworkers and laborers and, if elected, I will be the first Latino born and raised in Eastern Washington in the State Senate. I was able to go to UW because of the support of programs like the State Need Grant and Pell Grant and see it as my responsibility to ensure that the pathways that allowed me to come so far are even more open to the next generation. Since joining the legislature in 2017 I have been a leader in the legislature on racial equity, stopping gun violence, and our transition to a green transportation system, sponsoring legislation and leading the legislature on ending the ban on affirmative action in Washington, banning ghost guns and the sale of high capacity magazines, and expanding public transit and transportation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues that people share with me the most are addressing the housing crisis, our upside down tax structure, and combating climate change. I have worked to expand access and funding to low income housing and wrap around support systems so that our area stays affordable and as our homeless neighbors transition into long-term housing they have the support that is needed to ensure that transition is successful. Our tax structure is the most regressive in the country, our reliance on sales and property taxes puts the weight on the people in our communities least able to afford it, I fully support replacing these taxes with tools that reduce that burden. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington, we can and must transition to a green transportation system immediately, I have worked to expand access to public transit in our district including expanding pedestrian and bike infrastructure to ensure that it is safe to reach transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Licton Springs myself (you may have seen me in our local buy nothing group!)
and I’m running to represent the 46th because I love my neighborhood and I love my neighbors.
The last few years have been so hard for so many, and we’ve left too many folks without the help they need. I think we can, and must, do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many of our neighbors are sleeping on the streets because the cost of housing is too high and because
we haven’t provided them with the services they need to get on their feet. Instead of providing those services
and the investments in housing infrastructure that are so deeply needed, we inhumanely sweep our neighbors
from park to sidewalk to temporary shelters that aren’t appropriate to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long time residents of Seattle and the 46th district are constantly being priced out of our neighborhood
and forced to move further and further away, increasing their reliance on cars while feeling the impacts of climate change every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young parent, I want a future where my children will be able to afford to remain in the city they grew up in.
Sadly, unless we immediately address the housing crisis, this will not be a choice for our children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions we make now about education, housing and land use, transportation, and so much more will shape
the future for the next generation. We need to do more to ensure we are leaving our city
and state better than we found it, for the sake of our children and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing affordability and transportation are two of my top priorities, because of their impact on who can afford to continue living in our neighborhood and because they are both deeply connected to the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love enjoying our local stay healthy street on Ashworth with my family and as a state legislator would work to provide funds to expand the stay healthy streets and other open streets programs so that our neighborhood has more safe places to walk, roll, bike, and play. I would also like to invest in improving our beautiful park, including repairing the bathrooms and upgrading the play equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should use existing right-of-way for active transportation and transit, build more rail more quickly, provide more bus service, ensure transit connects to all the key destinations, and make transit free for all riders. Seattle currently has many bus routes that go north-south but very few heading east-west, which we feel the impact of in Licton Springs with no one bus route all the way to Golden Gardens or east of Northgate. We need these investments to give folks an alternative to driving and we should do all of this rather than expand existing highways or build new ones, which exacerbates existing environmental injustice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurora Avenue is also part of our community, and right now, it’s unsafe. Just a few days ago we saw yet another person killed while walking along Aurora by someone in their car. We &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that Aurora is unsafe, 17% of all fatalities on the roads in Seattle happen on Aurora, yet we haven’t fixed it. Crosswalks are few and far between, the sidewalks (when they actually exist) are narrow and crumbling. The people of North Seattle deserve better than a literal highway cutting through their neighborhood. While I’m pleased that the state legislature has appropriated $50 million to improve Aurora, and that SDOT has begun its safety project on Aurora, there is still plenty of work ahead to make sure it is done right. As a state legislator I will work hard to ensure that the intention behind these plans is carried out properly. Aurora Avenue must be rebuilt in a way that prioritizes safety, transit, and becomes a destination for our neighborhood rather than a speedway for cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington State hasn’t built enough housing to meet our needs, especially in our urban core and the 46th district. One of the effects is that we’ve made people move away from their jobs and communities in order to afford housing. I myself have had to move multiple times due to rent increases and unsafe living conditions.  When the legislature killed bills to build “missing middle” housing and include the climate crisis in the Growth Management Act, they not only undermined work to make housing more affordable, they also undermined work to reduce carbon emissions. I support bills to allow more affordable housing types to be built throughout our district, as well as tenant protections and statewide rent stabilization to ensure that renters have housing stability and can afford to remain in our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been your State Representative since December 2011. I’m on the University of Washington School of Public Health faculty. A key reason I’m running for re-election is because the State continues to need well-informed leadership to respond to COVID based on science, to learn from the Pandemic to prepare for future epidemics / pandemics and significantly improve our public health system. 
As a champion for improving public schools (including as “the Legislature’s top advocate for special education” [KING5], a champion for the right to health care and addressing the social determinants of health, leading construction of affordable housing and controlling rents, fighting for free college to end intergenerational poverty and as a long-time regional and national environmental leader fighting climate change, I’m running because there’s much more work to be done! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran for office following many years of organizing with PTAs, Paramount Duty and other organizations to fund public schools. When Seattle Public Schools was unable to lower class sizes due to lack of classroom space, I was one of the founding organizers of the effort to fund new and expanded school buildings. When I became a legislator, I led funding for Cascadia Elementary and Robert Eaglestaff Middle School, and now Northgate Elementary. This year, I played a major role in finally changing school funding to fund a nurse in every school (increasing from the state providing just .07 of a nurse per school (seven one-hundredths)).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a leader in fighting climate change and working for environmental justice, including helping to write and pass our legislation to end use of fossil fuels for electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been called the most accessible and open legislator in Washington. I return to the district every Saturday during session for my drop-in discussion time (“Traveling Town Halls). I also serve on the board of the Coalition for Open Government and authored and passed our new legislation guaranteeing you the right to comment at city or county council and other board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with community councils and neighborhood organizations is reflected in my leading the years-long effort to fund and build the pedestrian and bike bridge connecting North Seattle College and Licton Springs with the new light rail station. I’m working to improve circulating bus transit to light rail and rapid bus lines. I’ve worked to fund the planning for major pedestrian improvements and safety along Aurora. Huge portions of our district are not safe for walking or bicycling, including routes for our children to walk to school. I will continue to work to fund sidewalks in partnership with the City. Safety along Aurora and in our neighborhoods needs to improve for residents to be willing to walk to stores, and for our store employees to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homelessness continues to be an unconscionable crisis in north Seattle. It is unconscionable and a public health crisis to turn a blind eye to large encampments in parks, school playgrounds and along rights of way. That’s why I helped provide tens of millions of dollars to move people from homeless encampments into &lt;strong&gt;rapid rehousing&lt;/strong&gt; with behavioral health, mental health, and job services. It’s been frustrating to have Seattle not use those funds. I’m pleased that this is now changing.  We also need much more &lt;strong&gt;permanent supportive housing&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve led the effort to fund and build hundreds new affordable housing units here in the 46th District, bringing together community members to advise the agencies in how to develop housing and to include health clinics and childcare in the buildings. As Chair of the Local Government Committee, I’ve insisted that policies to increase density include commitments to prevent displacement of low-income residents and racially diverse communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also led the work to have the State partner with the City to develop new community centers – recognizing the need for centers in Licton Springs and Lake City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many residents also benefit from my having developed the model for free community college reflected in “the Seattle Promise,” which allows for our high school graduates to attend North Seattle College tuition free. However, Seattle Colleges’ workforce training programs, including health care professions, are in jeopardy. As one of our legislative leaders on college and workforce training access, I’m working to develop a new formula for the State to fully fund community and technical college workforce programs which are very important to both high school grads and people looking to improve their careers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On personal note I am a technology consultant and mother of 2 teenagers.  I am a statewide community advocate working with legislators creating legislation that has made our lives better.  I grew up in a military family – my dad served in the Vietnam War but unfortunately suffered from PTSD as a result of the war but come from family of farmworkers and small business owners.  I have a PROVEN RECORD and experience passing successful legislation in Olympia which means when elected I will be prepared to get to work. I currently serve as Board Chair of Latino Civic Alliance, a civil rights organization • Governor Inslee Task Force Appointee: - Independent Investigations involving Police Use of Force - Hate Crime Advisory Working Group - Agriculture Labor Rights • Improving small businesses with access to capital &amp;amp; technical assistance • Supporting our essential workers, like teachers and nurses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Legislature I will prioritize 1) K-12 Education Retaining Teachers- there is warning of mass exodus of teachers in the Seattle school districts from burnout from COVID pandemic.  I have met with teachers, and they have personally told me they are overworked and also worried about their students mental health needs.  The legislature needs to provide additional financial support to retain teachers and invest in additional support staff paraeducators. 2) Increase access to mental health services for youth.  Although the legislature has approved substantial funding to behavioral health providers – there is still a serious gap of families understanding how to access services for their children and long waiting lists up to 3 months at Seattle Children’s Hospital, community health providers, behavioral health counselors and clinical care. 3) Gun violence: I want to support the ban on assault weapons but also focus on youth having access to illegal guns – unfortunately in the 46th and other districts in the state exits 4) Small Businesses: Many small businesses in the 46th closed during pandemic but many are struggling to remain open or retain staff.  The legislature can do more to help businesses attain capital and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m running simply because the 46th District is my home. I'm invested in the health of this community. I've lived here my entire life and attended elementary through high school in the district. In fact, when my parents fled Iran because of the revolution they met at my high school, Roosevelt, and put down roots in Lake City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few places you can go in Lake City without being directly confronted by the housing and behavioral health crisis and seeing neighbors cycling through the criminal legal system. These issues have been core to my role as Public Policy Director at Disability Rights Washington where I work with the legislature to create meaningful change for our communities. Not only do I have legislative experience, I also know whats happening on the ground. I’m part of a team that oversees 12 behavioral health diversion programs across the state. These programs are doing well enough to have received funding from the legislature to continue their work. These are programs that meet people where they are at to provide help as soon as its needed. We need a system that provides help the moment it's needed, not after individuals have fallen through every hole in our systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also running because representation matters. We need to elect people individuals who have the best interest of our communities in mind because it is also in their best interest. I’m interested in bringing attention to neighborhoods that haven’t received the support they need like Lake City and the Aurora corridor. And I’m running to represent my communities. As a first-generation young Iranian American woman, I know exactly what its like to not have my voice heard. If I’m elected, I would proudly serve as the youngest to ever serve the district and the first Middle Eastern woman in the Washington State Legislature. We need a representative who has a proven track record of successfully tackling hard issues in Olympia, someone who understands how these policies work on the ground, and one who knows what it means and how it looks to lift every voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My priority is the intersection of behavioral health, housing and homelessness, and the criminal legal system because these are the issues directly impacting my neighbors and constituents. I live in the Lake City neighborhood, a lower-income community of color, where you can’t go anywhere without being directly confronted by the behavioral health and housing crisis. Over 40% of people experiencing homelessness have a disability, many a behavioral health disability. In Washington State, our lack of a behavioral health system drives people with serious psychiatric disabilities into the revolving door of homelessness, crisis, incarceration, and institutionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current system misses the mark because it focuses on providing care only when someone meets criteria for involuntary treatment. This is a fine line to walk, and many tip over this line into the criminal legal system during crisis. Involuntary commitment was designed to be a last resort, not the cornerstone of our behavioral health system yet our current system is centered around it. This is the work I know best as Public Policy Director at Disability Rights Washington and as part of the Trueblood Court Monitor’s Diversion Team. I’ve spent the last several years overseeing 12 different diversion programs across the state which do just this, provide help as soon as help is needed. I’m proud to say these programs are doing well enough that they just recently received funding from the state legislature to keep them running. In the House, I would continue to do this work, and redirect our focus from involuntary services and criminal legal investments to community-based programs that intervene as soon as individuals need help – not after it's too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day job, I advocate for a behavioral health system with true choice that intervenes at the earliest possible point, for many this starts in grade school. And, if elected, I will use my platform to elevate the urgency of this work. Washington State wastes millions of dollars waiting for people to reach a crisis level of care before providing treatment. We can save money and lives by providing low-barrier accessible housing, addressing basic needs, and a full spectrum of care for our residents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create meaningful access and treatment options, we need leaders who understand how individuals accessing resources interact with, and rely on, public service systems. I will work for a system that supports individuals with a variety of behavioral health needs, including culturally relevant and LGBTQIA+ responsive services, school-based therapy, outpatient services, disability specific care, and permanent supportive housing with wraparound supports. I will work for a system that provides care as soon as care is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to make this vision a reality, we must take care of those who care for us. There is a serious shortage of behavioral health professionals. The schooling required to become a behavioral health professional takes a significant amount of time and money. This results in a less diverse and smaller pool of professionals and fewer individuals pursuing specializations. Once individuals meet the requirements necessary to pursue employment, they are not taken care of as employees. Our healthcare providers are underpaid, undertrained, and as a result, understaffed. The healthcare providers, social workers, certified peer counselors, and caregivers we rely on to take care of some of our most vulnerable are not treated well. If we want to transform our behavioral health system, we must start by taking care of our behavioral health providers. I will work to make sure they are paid a living wage, are provided the training they need to successfully provide individualized care, and ensure they are encouraged to pursue specializations. By properly supporting our workforce, we encourage others from diverse backgrounds to pursue this career path and increase the number of providers’ range of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working as a pediatrician for over twenty years, I have had the privilege of being there for thousands of patients and families in our community who share their stories and entrust me with their struggles and triumphs. Running for elected office is a natural extension of the work I am already doing. I have long viewed caring for my patients to include advocacy in the policy realm. Kids can’t vote. So they count on those of us who care for them to stand up on their behalf.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 14 years ago, I became active with the Washtington Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Legislative Committee. I chaired that group for six of the past years and have had the opportunity to do extensive policy work in Olympia through this affiliation. My work in Olympia reflects my values and priorities. I’ve helped to create the Children’s Mental Health Work Group, established Medicaid payment for developmental and autism screens for children, and established a single phone line referral resource for children with behavioral health needs. I've also advocated for Paid Family Leave, to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco and nicotine products to 21, and promoted gun safety through safe storage, child access prevention, universal background checks, and extreme risk protection orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to bring each of my patients’ families and their stories to Olympia, and give them all a seat at the table to influence policy for our state. It will be an honor to work to end health disparities for kids and families in my community by addressing all of the economic and social conditions that determine the health and well-being of members of our community. So many of the challenges faced by my families require changes at the systems level, and that is what I hope to create as a state legislator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My connection to my neighbors in the 46th LD and my approach to politics are inspired by my experiences as a physician and a mom. My goal as a public servant is to nourish and advocate for the most vulnerable members of my community by (1) improving access to public services that contribute to the social determinants of health like quality, accessable healthcare, education, housing, food, and childcare (2) combating the economic unevenness that too often determines the health and wellness of our kids and families, particularly inequality that stems from bias based on marginalized identities such as race, class, religion, disability, gender, and sexual orientation, and (3) protecting a safe and nurturing environment by promoting gun safety, regulating access to toxins like vape products and flame retardants, and protecting our bountiful natural environment. As a mom in the 46th, I know how important these issues are for families in our district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I want to improve healthcare access, invest fully in mental health, and ensure safe (legally safe, as we know that abortions are quite physically safe) accessible reproductive health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will prioritize building safe, affordable, sustainable communities with the housing and transit we need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will champion revenue reform to invest in a strong foundation for Washington’s kids—from childcare to K-12 to college and career pathways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always carry the intimate and complex needs of my neighbors into my advocacy, and I will listen to my community with compassion every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should residents of Licton Springs know about you, your background, and your
general priorities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently a physician with the University of Washington - Harborview Downtown Clinics,
providing care for people experiencing homelessness in downtown Seattle. Previously, I served
as a physician and Medical Director at Virginia Mason Medical Center, Lynnwood, and an
Assistant Professor of Infectious Disease at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our community experiences the interwoven pandemics of COVID, increasing homelessness,
the worsening mental health and addiction crises, without an apparent end in sight, it is
heartbreaking to see this impacting our neighborhoods, my patients and our entire state. I am
tired of witnessing slow and inadequate attempts to fix these problems. I want to be part of our
state’s government working on real, substantive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am committed to working on safety and security, our inadequate and often inaccessible mental
health and addiction services and increasing our supply of affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe are priority issues that are distinctive to District 46?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not absolutely distinctive to the 46th, our crisis of a lack of affordable homes and the
resultant increase in people living outside in public spaces is certainly a problem in the 46th.
Also, the decline in safety and security, with increased thefts, violence and vandalism are a sign
of an unhealthy community in need of bigger solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we need to first address the problem of safety and security in our neighborhoods by
adopting a more restorative justice approach. People need to be held accountable for their
actions, but this accountability should result in behavior change and rehabilitation rather than
just punishment and release to the same situation, or worse, than before they committed a
crime. I believe we need to prioritize community courts, mental health and drug courts as well as
improving our mental health and addiction services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this must be done with an eye to sustainability. As we increase our supply of affordable
housing and increase density, a requirement demanded by our increasing population and the
worsening of our climate crisis, it must be done in a sustainable way, optimizing efficiency and
decreasing the need for and use of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie’s and Liz’s terms end next month. Mike moved to nominate them for another term. Bekah seconded the motion. The motion will be voted on at the April meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah gave a summary of the by-laws related to board nominations and officer elections. Open positions can be filled any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licton-springs-park-work-parties"&gt;Licton Springs Park Work Parties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz talked about work parties in Licton Springs Park and shared a flyer. Work parties are the second Saturday of every month from 10am to 1pm, rain or shine. Neighbors can meet work party leaders at the comfort station at the park at 97th and Ashworth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey shared a few notes from Jenny Frankl with the City of Seattle’s Adopt-A-Street program. The city is planning on hosting a ‘One Seattle Day of Service’ on Sat, May 21. This will be a citywide call to action around beautification and cleanup. She suggested synergy with the work parties in the park, but the dates don’t coincide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt-A-Street is hosting their annual spring clean, where they support volunteers in doing one-time cleanups. They will provide supplies related to trash cleanup. Matt Gautrowski is going to fill out the form to register for a Licton Springs cleanup event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="music-in-the-park"&gt;Music in the Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey reported that LSCC was not chosen for Arts in the Park funding from the City of Seattle. 68 projects applied and there was not enough funding to go around. LSCC is still interested in moving forward in hosting an event in August. Rob from Boundless Northwest is interested in collaborating. A couple of attendees suggested other funding sources, including donations from local businesses and contributions from neighbors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janice Holkup asked about outreach to Clear Sky Native Youth Council for musical acts. Lindsey confirmed that including an indigenous musical act is a priority for the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="community-outreach-for-neighborhood-events"&gt;Community Outreach for Neighborhood Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSCC Contacts: Melanie created a spreadsheet with names and contact information for frequent contacts of LSCC. Bekah requested a column for notes so that we can keep track of who was contacted, when, and by whom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Board of Directors communication: Lindsey outlined a proposal for a process for communicating with and booking guest speakers for LSCC meetings. The primary contact for the potential guest speaker should do the initial outreach and copy Lindsey on the email. Once the guest speaker confirms, the primary contact will be responsible for sending them the Zoom information and agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey also requested that when directors communicate via email, to make sure that each general topic has its own email thread. This will keep email communication clearer and less intimidating to wade through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upcoming guest speakers: At the time of the meeting, guest speakers for the next few meetings are as follows: April - Aurora Reimagined Coalition, May - [Potentially] someone from the North Precinct or SPD, June - City Attorney Ann Davison and Bellwether Housing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group discussed moving Bellwether to July instead of having two major guest speakers in May. Lindsey will reach out to Bellwether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike is the primary contact for LSCC with Ann Davison’s office. He suggested asking the community what they would like to hear from her so we can get questions to her office in advance and keep things running smoothly at the event. Lindsey will do a Google form and share via email and social media as a way to collect questions. This will go out on May 4 with a May 25 deadline for submissions. Mike will send questions to Ann Davison’s office on June 1, two weeks before the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion about how to host the meeting so that it doesn’t become an open/rowdy discussion. Bekah suggested hosting it in a webinar format. She volunteered to moderate the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adjournment"&gt;Adjournment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;General Members Present: Mary Katka, Ellen Beck, Kevin Sheets, Janice Holkup, Matt Gautreau, Johnna Reitz, Brooke Jolitz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Visitors Present: Oliver Bazinet, Senior Planner, City of Seattle; Osbaldo Hernandez, Community Engagement Coordinator, City of Seattle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="welcome-and-introductions"&gt;Welcome and Introductions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:32. Attendees introduced themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-guests"&gt;Hearing from Neighbors &amp;amp; Guests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oliver Bazinet gave an update on the City of Seattle’s plans to rebuild the comfort station at Licton Springs Park. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A senior architect is working on a permit package for demolition, which should be submitted this week. There will be an appointment for permit intake within 8-12 weeks, maybe sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The city will partially demolish the restroom portion and leave the storage room in the back. The facility is in an environmentally critical area and if it’s fully demolished, the city may not be able to build it again where it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demo work will hopefully happen in May or June, potentially sooner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parks &amp;amp; Rec has identified funding for planning and design of a replacement. Non-gender specific restrooms and specialized locking mechanisms will be part of the project. The full project will probably take a couple of years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike asked about a budget for art. Oliver said that 1% for art funding is usually for new projects but this project may have access to Parks &amp;amp; Rec funding for art. Community would hopefully be involved in selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting attendees shared thoughts on priorities for the project, including accessibility and safety (for children especially), acknowledgment of the significance of the site to Native American communities, storage of tools used by volunteers who help maintain the park, and durable trash cans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with questions/comment can direct them to Oliver at oliver.bazinet@seattle.gov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Osbaldo Hernandez came to reconnect with the group and provide a couple of updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayor Harrell is changing the way his administration does outreach and community engagement. Osbaldo will let us know when plans are final.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be new programs with public safety in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Osbaldo has been working with the Aurora Reimagined Coalition, SDOT, and King County Metro on preparing for the study on north Aurora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie was interested in how the new mayor will be reaching out to diverse communities and helping neighborhood associations do that as well. None of the previous planning has reached the community. Osbaldo will keep us updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey encouraged everyone to complete the City of Seattle’s survey about recreation and community gathering space needs in the neighborhood. Survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AuroraLictonSprings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report"&gt;Approval of Minutes &amp;amp; Treasurer's Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a motion to approve the minutes from the January 19 meeting. The motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey noted incorrect dates on the Treasurer’s report. There was a motion to approve the Treasurer’s Report with revisions. The motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee"&gt;By-Laws Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah gave an overview of the by-laws committee’s process in proposing revisions and explained the goals of today’s discussion and vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen asked whether adoption would change the elections coming up this spring. Bekah said the revised by-laws won’t change that. There was a discussion about straightening out director terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie moved to approve the proposed by-laws. Bob seconded the motion. All board members voted for the motion as well as LSCC members Janice, Kevin, Brooke, and Mary. The motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In response to a follow-up question from Mike, Bekah said that there is no legal requirement to have dues. Additionally, we are allowed to change our by-laws as we see fit and we do not need to file them with the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-issues"&gt;Other Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the last meeting, Kathleen drafted a letter reconnecting with Councilmember Debra Juarez following her election as President of the City Council but didn’t get approval. There was a discussion about the letter she drafted. She finalized it and emailed it to Councilmember Juarez’s office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey asked Mike if it’s possible to have a representative from the North Precinct at the May meeting. Mike will reach out to ask about availability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah noted that the March meeting is the one where director nominations will happen, so everyone should bring a friend who’s interested in getting involved. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a short discussion about the history of efforts to build a community center in Licton Springs. Melanie talked about ALUV’s work on this prior to the pandemic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adjournment"&gt;Adjournment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie adjourned the meeting at 7:34pm.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="welcome-introductions-and-hearing-from-neighbors"&gt;Welcome, Introductions, and Hearing from Neighbors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracy Cramer showed attendees the current litter route in Licton Springs and asked for suggestions on changes to the route, which several attendees provided. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked for an update on the needle boxes and cleanup program. Traci said Michael Eckers is now heading up that program. The program still does needle trainings and gives out needle boxes. Traci noted that the Adopt-a-Street program also distributes needle boxes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with questions about these programs can contact Tracy at tracy.cramer@seattle.gov or text/call 206.643.3682.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jason Hennessy’s firm, BERK Consulting, Inc. has been engaged by the City of Seattle to help with a feasibility study for community gathering spaces at Aurora Licton Village. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BERK is looking at space availability and will be doing some community engagement to ask for input on space needs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The survey should be available soon. Lindsey said LSCC would be happy to use our communications channels to distribute the survey to the neighborhood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees gave Jason suggestions on local organizations to reach out to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BERK is hoping to have their report available by the end of March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="approval-of-minutes-from-november-17-2021-and-treasurers-report"&gt;Approval of Minutes from November 17, 2021 and Treasurer’s Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah noted a change to her response to Evelyn’s question about a planned psychiatric hospital. It is a private company, not Bellwether housing, constructing the facility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amended minutes and treasurer’s report were approved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="north-precinct-update"&gt;North Precinct Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Cuadra shared a few points from the most recent North Precinct Meeting. First, if anyone in the neighborhood has seen an occurrence where there was a police presence, they can file a records request with the city and learn about what was going on. [Seattle Police Department Records Request Center: https://spd-seattle.mycusthelp.com/webapp/_rs/(S(j0m2yt1iwvxx3mms5cokkpov))/supporthome.aspx?sSessionID=6718311829IIUYBMFBJVTJERYNERYZASMHPZHEMX&amp;amp;lp=3 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike noted that in general, crime is down in the North Precinct. However, certain types of crime like vehicle theft and aggravated assault are up. Fentanyl use is still a problem. Citywide, crime is up. Mike said that the North Precinct meetings are different than they used to be because there are certain crimes the department is not responding to as much because of funding issues and limited resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="letter-of-congratulations-to-councilmember-juarez"&gt;Letter of Congratulations to Councilmember Juarez&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen suggested the council send a brief letter of congratulations to Councilmember Juarez for being elected president of Seattle City Council. There was a discussion about ethical issues involved and whether this could be seen as LSCC endorsing a candidate. Directors shared various views on this. Ultimately Melanie made a motion to allow Kathleen to draft a letter with a low-key expression of congratulations, but with the bigger goal of reminding Councilmember Juarez that the council is still here and letting her know what we have been doing. Lindsey seconded the motion and it passed unanimously. Kathleen will send a draft around by email to directors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="arts-in-the-park-application"&gt;Arts in the Park Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey submitted an application in December for $2600 in Arts in the Park funding for a neighborhood concert in Licton Springs Park. We should find out whether we will receive the funding in early February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee-update"&gt;By-Laws Committee Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah gave a short presentation on the status of the LSCC by-laws update that included a summary of by-laws and what they do, major and minor changes to the LSCC by-laws by the by-laws committee, and a timeline review. Janice asked what the boundaries are for membership in LSCC. They are Northgate Way to the north, Aurora to the west, 85th to the south, and I-5 to the east. Residents within these boundaries are eligible to be members of LSCC. Kathleen asked if the definition of members changes if we drop the dues requirement/option. Bekah is going to look into this to double check that we can do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah will send the draft updated by-laws to the directors via email to review and suggest any changes in advance of a planned vote at the February meeting. Lindsey will send out the by-laws to our email list two weeks in advance of the February meeting for review. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie made a motion to vote on the updated by-laws at the next meeting. Liz seconded the motion. The motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaun Vinyard moved to Licton Springs from Wedgwood and wants to get more familiar with issues in the Licton Springs neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evelyn Lemon asked whether a psychiatric hospital is being built in the neighborhood? Bekah shared that a private company is building a senior inpatient and family center. Melanie shared that there is supportive services and housing at 96th and Aurora. Shaun shared that UW is building an inpatient psychiatric hospital currently and thinks it will be a great addition to mental health care in the greater Seattle area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janice Holkup noted that apartments are going to be demolished across from the playfield near the school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licton-springs-park"&gt;Licton Springs Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In her capacity as park steward at Licton Springs Park, Liz gave an update on the park. 300 plants were recently delivered and the volunteer team can use all the help they can get in placing/planting them. There are work parties going on every month. [LW note: those meetings are noted on the calendar on the LSCC website]. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the comfort station (restrooms), Liz said there was an insurance investigator there one day when she was at the park and a Seattle Parks &amp;amp; Recreation employee unlocked the fence. Both said the fire was the result of arson. The city’s insurance was for $200,000 and that may end up being the cost to rebuild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz asked the insurance investigator and the Parks &amp;amp; Rec employee if they could save anything from the building. However, the fire was so intense that it compromised the integrity of the metal so the answer was no. Liz said it would be nice to be able to store tools in the new structure but for $200,000 it might be difficult. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie suggested that Parks &amp;amp; Rec staff may be looking for additional funds for the structure. She volunteered to write a letter to Parks (with Liz’s help) outlining how the facility has been used and what we would like. Mike said it never hurts to get letters of support, and maybe it would be a good avenue to get tribal support. Kathleen talked about the Muckleshoot tribe’s charitable fund and how the council could apply for $5,000 from that fund for educational signage for when the facility gets rebuilt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="halloween-recap"&gt;Halloween Recap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah said the Halloween decorating raffle and neighborhood map were very well received across the neighborhood and there were many participants. The digital map was viewed 2,776 times. There was a motion to approve $45 from the LSCC account to cover part of the raffle prize that were not donated. The motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="north-precinct-meeting"&gt;North Precinct Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Cuadra gave a summary of the last North Precinct meeting. Nicole Macri of the Downtown Emergency Service Center talked about emergency services. DESC recently purchased two hotels to provide permanent supportive housing services. Lindsey asked about whethere P2P meth had ever been discussed at these meetings and whether it’s been part of the homelessness issue in Seattle. Mike said it has been discussed and it is a problem here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="arts-in-the-park-funding"&gt;Arts in the Park Funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey talked about the open funding opportunity for Arts in the Park funding and suggested partnering with Boundless NW on an event next summer. She said she would submit an application for funding for a neighborhood concert and would get in touch with Rob from Boundless NW to discuss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="art-selection-committee"&gt;Art Selection Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSCC has the opportunity to nominate someone on the art selection committee for the fire station on Meridian. There was a motion to nominate Bekah Gautrowski and the motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee"&gt;By-Laws Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion about how the council forms the agenda and how that should be reflected in the by-laws. Directors also discussed allowing a consent agenda (there was wide approval) and what constitutes appropriate notice for upcoming meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="welcome-introductions"&gt;Welcome &amp;amp; Introductions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="housing-at-north-seattle-college"&gt;Housing at North Seattle College&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaders from Chief Seattle Club (CSC), Bellwether Housing (BH), North Seattle College (NSC), and architects for the planned affordable housing at North Seattle College talked about various aspects of the project and answered questions from residents. The project will include about 200 housing units with a target population of those earning up to 60% of the Area Median Income, especially those in the low wage workforce. Expected completion is in late 2024 and expected opening in early 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gregory Hinton of NSC gave a short summary of the original Request for Proposals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derrick Belgrade, Executive Director of CSC, talked about the org’s mission of tackling issues for Native Americans and low income individuals and families. CSC mainly provides social services but recently expanded into real estate and housing. They are excited to build housing for families and foster community, health, and well-being with this project, including the longhouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Susan Boyd, CEO of BH, talked about the target population for the project. In addition to people with low incomes, outreach will focus on younger households and Native American households. Almost half of the units are 2- and 3-bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Bodoia, an architect for the project, talked about the location, which is on the SE corner of the NSC property. It is close to parks, schools, and new transit development. The property has interesting topography and exceptional trees. Some of the trees will be removed, some retained. The city does not require saving trees if it hinders development potential of a site. Asked whether the project will affect nearby wetlands, he said it is well outside of the protected boundary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project is organized around four courtyards, each with its own character and purpose. An underground garage will have spaces for about 80 cars. The longhouse will be on the north part of the property due to the location of significant trees. At the south part of the property, there will be a natural amphitheater. Two housing buildings will be connected by a raised open air bridge. There will be a playground on the east side. Asked whether the project will impact the P-Patch, he said there is a study underway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architect JohnPaul Jones noted that the building is open to the street, which makes the development more pleasing for neighbors and allows sun and air into the development to the benefit of the residents. Current zoning allows the project as planned. Modeled after traditional longhouses, the longhouse on the property will seat 150-200 people indoors and can also host outdoor gatherings. The goal is to create inviting spaces to help native and non-native communities enjoy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be an opportunity to comment on the design during a second review process as the design progresses. Information on opportunities will be public. Residents within 300 feet of the site will get a notice in the mail about review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terrence from NSC talked about expected student enrollment in the coming years. The college anticipates students returning to campus after the pandemic but not at historical levels, in part because of increased hybrid course options. When this project is finished, the number of students will be lower. In past years the college has considered student housing with a focus on international students. However, there has been a drastic reduction in these students coming to campus so there isn’t enough demand to justify it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residents of Licton Springs and anyone else who is interested can go to https://www.bellwetherhousing.org/northseattlecollege for information on the project and email NSChousing@bellwetherhousing.org with questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licton-springs-park-restroom-update"&gt;Licton Springs Park Restroom Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike shared that the folks in Seattle Parks &amp;amp; Rec working on this will be getting a demo permit for the comfort station and are working on a design and permitting to rebuild. Liz’s email to Kathleen said the architect on the project told her it will be rebuilt on a timeline of 2-3 years, pending asbestos and lead testing. There will be an opportunity for public comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="community-councils-meeting-on-homelessness"&gt;Community Councils Meeting on Homelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several LSCC board members attended a meeting of north Seattle community councils convened by Blair Perilman of the Greenlake Community Council. Reps from different community councils attended for a discussion on actions community councils can take collectively to spur the city into more urgent action on the loss of open space due to encampments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion about the demise of district councils and whether the City Council would appreciate hearing from the community councils. Melanie said at the meeting there was a consensus about putting together a letter asking the city to let community groups know what is going on and what will happen moving forward since there is a lack of information coming out to local groups (contrary to what was planned under the Murray administration to keep local groups more informed). It is probably wise to hold off on a letter until after elections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen sent Blair a list of block captains in the north precinct and people she knew were interested in a revised version of district councils. She also pointed out that there are tools that have been developed internally at the city to help address diversity issues. She wondered whether the city could share those tools with neighborhoods so we can work on expanding and diversifying the voices being heard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licton-springs-halloween"&gt;Licton Springs Halloween&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah is heading up the creation of the trick-or-treat and decorated home map for the neighborhood and said she would release the first draft on Saturday. Submissions for inclusion on the map would be accepted until midnight that day. There was a discussion of a raffle prize for home decorating. Bekah will approach local businesses for small gift cards to put together as a prize. The group discussed a potential allowance from the LSCC account should there be low interest from businesses in donating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aurora-reimagined-coalition"&gt;Aurora Reimagined Coalition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie attended the coalition’s last meeting, which included a discussion about the Safe Routes to Schools program. Right now there is a great need for crossing guards, but a major shortage in part because of harassment crossing guards endure here. Many crossing guards are also not comfortable working on Aurora because of the speed of cars there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 21 is a world day of remembrance for victims of traffic violence. There was a discussion at the coalition meeting about closing lanes at 100th and putting up tables, etc. to remember victims of traffic accidents. Melanie will find out more because there are potential opportunities to volunteer/participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coalition is getting a lot of conversations going with various stakeholders in advance of SDOT’s deadline early next year to initiate a study of Aurora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report"&gt;Approval of Minutes &amp;amp; Treasurer's Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minutes from the September meeting and the Treasurer’s Report were approved. Bekah asked if the tools purchase noted on the Treasurer’s Report was due to loss because of the fire at the park restrooms but Liz was not available to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee-update"&gt;By-Laws Committee Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion of officer election and nomination procedures, and who should be considered a voting member at LSCC meetings. Lindsey said in order to make every attendee a voting member, the structure of how the council runs would need to change because by and large, board members are the only people consistently attending the meetings. No one had any major changes to the nomination or election process. Bekah said in most similar groups, the board elects the officers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah emailed each officer with the current description of their position and asked them to note any changes they would like to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors"&gt;Hearing from Neighbors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neighborhood resident Fernando Cervantes brought up an improperly posted notice of a property change near his home having to do with removing trees. The process seemed shady as if the people in charge of the project wanted to sidestep the comment process. He had concerns with the design review process being very fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment in chat from Robin Amadon: I would like to see a community organization unity around linking all the new units being built and bought for our homeless neighbors with the specific concentrations of outdoor neighbors. I am not seeing this connection…so that the homeless cohorts get outreach and the chance to move into the various homeless housing options that are advancing and available to occupy.  For example, there is a new 65 unit project finishing at 81st and Greenwood by Inland Construction selling to Catholic Communit Services of Western Washington. As far as I have  hear, there has been NO outreach by CCS TO the Greenlake/Woodland Park homeless neighbors to get permanent and affordable housing.  This seems a shame—the silos need to cooperate to show an improvement.  The city is just backing away because the problem has been allowed to grow so large in scale.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees introduced themselves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-visitors"&gt;Hearing from Neighbors &amp;amp; Visitors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees. Martha said she was interested in hearing more about plans for Halloween in the neighborhood. Moses was interested in learning more about the council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report"&gt;Approval of Minutes &amp;amp; Treasurer's Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minutes and Treasurer’s Report were approved. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="organization-for-afghan-refugee-resettlement"&gt;Organization for Afghan Refugee Resettlement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen requested this agenda item but by the time of the meeting, World Relief was no longer putting together resettlement kits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="discussion-about-halloween-event"&gt;Discussion about Halloween Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion on how to move forward with a Halloween event this year given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Melanie gave a history of the event, which has been a trick-or-treat event in Licton Springs Park with “stations” where volunteers hand out candy and cider to attendees. There have also been musicians in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob suggested that we make a call on whether to hold the event a week ahead of time. However, Melanie said she would need more time to organize volunteers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group discussed alternative locations or confining it to one half of the park, given that there are people living in the park currently. Kathleen noted the charm of the event has been in its being spread across the whole park. Alternative potential locations were at one of the two schools on 90th, Mineral Springs Park, North Seattle College, or on the new pedestrian bridge. Lindsey will reach out to relevant contacts about the two latter locations. Residents near Mineral Springs Park pointed out the difficulty with parking in that area and historically holding meetings at Cascadia Elementary has been challenging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah suggested a house decorating contest and house-to-house trick-or-treating with an associated map that could be distributed to residents. The event could include a prize. Melanie moved to give Bekah the go-ahead to start planning that, regardless of whether there is an in-person event. Bob seconded and the motion passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="response-to-fire-in-licton-springs-park"&gt;Response to Fire in Licton Springs Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz relayed information to the group about the fire. It happened on Saturday, September 4th. Residents across the street from the park were awoken at 4:30am, hearing glass breaking. The restroom was fully engulfed in flames. No one was hurt. No one had information about who was responsible for the fire. Seattle Parks has said informally that the structure will need to be taken down and will cost $150k to replace. Liz has not been able to get any official information however. The department has brought in two porta-potties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion of statements/letters about the fire from LSCC to volunteers and other interested parties. Kathleen suggested that Liz express condolences to volunteers and that LSCC express sadness and concern to the Native American communities who just celebrated the historic status of the park. Kathleen also wanted to reiterate questions to Councilmember Juarez about plans to investigate and rebuild. She said she would reach out to UNEA as well as the landmarks board to find out whether the park’s historic landmark status will impact where it fits in the queue of parks projects to be completed. She noted that whoever burned the restroom facility also violated the city ordinance on destruction of places of historical/cultural significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen will draft a letter to Councilmember Juarez’ office inquiring about any investigation. Mike suggested that the council should be thinking about going to the Park Oversight Committee and be in contact with the park commissioners (longer-term). Mike said he would talk to his contacts in constructions at the Parks department about who to talk to there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz asked about tribal involvement in getting the structure rebuilt. Bekah said this should be the City’s responsibility and the City has not given us tools to fix problems in the park.  Kathleen took photos and sent them to the Seattle Times, but thus far there hasn’t been media coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pillings-pond"&gt;Pillings Pond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz contacted the owner of the Pillings Pond property and the adjacent house to find more about what’s going on there currently. They are looking for someone to rent the house. This would be at a reduced rate, but the renters are also responsible for feeding the ducks in the morning and evening. The person next door and a few other people are volunteering while the owner looks for new renters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee"&gt;By-Laws Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah will send a by-laws related email by the end of the month. Board members should look through the discussion questions. She expects the by-laws review/revision process to be complete by the end of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lscc-history"&gt;LSCC History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie and Mary gave a summary of the history of the Licton Springs Community Council for new attendees. LSCC’s main goals include making neighborhood resident voices heard and trying to connect people to information on issues they care about that are relevant to the neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. Attendees introduced themselves. Melanie let everyone know the meeting would end at about 7pm to allow folks to attend the Aurora Reimagined Coalition’s community workshop. She gave a short description of the group’s work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-visitors"&gt;Hearing from Neighbors &amp;amp; Visitors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees. Wendy Leung introduced herself as a neighborhood resident for the past six years. She is concerned about crime rates and traffic, and would like to see better signage around the neighborhood encouraging drivers to slow down. Melanie told the group about Seattle Greenways, which has a HomeZone project aimed at slowing traffic on non-arterial streets.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="approval-of-minutes-treasurers-report"&gt;Approval of Minutes &amp;amp; Treasurer's Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minutes and Treasurer’s Report were approved. Bekah asked for clarification on what was meant in the Treasurer’s Report by “Ending Balance reflects $10.00 held in PayPal account.” Liz explained that Kevin Sheets made a $10.00 donation to LSCC via PayPal and that she is working on getting the balance transferred to the LSCC bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hearing-from-neighbors-visitors"&gt;Hearing from Neighbors &amp;amp; Visitors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees but there were none at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="potential-play-street"&gt;Potential Play Street&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah talked about the possibility of a closed play street sometime this summer, likely on Densmore. She said the permit process through the city is not complicated and the cost is low. There was a discussion about whether to have this as a separate event as the music in the park event Lindsey is working on, the group decided a separate event would be better so as not to take attention away from any musical performance. Bekah will take the lead on planning this for sometime in August and will provide information to the Board of Directors via email or at the next meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="music-in-the-park-update"&gt;Music in the Park Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey has been corresponding with Boundless NW about planning a Music in the Park event at Licton Springs Park in either July or August. Rob with Boundless NW has been in touch with the City of Seattle about permits, and it shouldn’t be a heavy lift in that respect. Rob’s suggestion is to have centralized music with a small stage. Lindsey will keep the group updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="by-laws-committee-update"&gt;By-laws Committee Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bekah let everyone know the By-Laws Committee, an ad hoc committee that is working on updating LSCC’s by-laws, will meet on June 29th at 7:00pm via Zoom. Anyone is welcome to join this meeting.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="northgate-pedestrian-bridge-update"&gt;Northgate Pedestrian Bridge Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey let the group know the section of the bridge over northbound I-5 has been installed and this coming weekend southbound I-5 will be closed and cars will be rerouted so the other section can be installed. More information at SDOT’s website here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="north-seattle-college-presidents-advisory-board-update"&gt;North Seattle College President's Advisory Board Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey is now the LSCC representative to the NSC President’s Advisory Board update. The meeting in May included introductions of NSC leadership and advisory board members, NSC actions to address COVID-19, and an update on the upcoming Bellwether Housing project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="greenlake-community-center-update"&gt;Greenlake Community Center Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike gave a status report on the Green Lake Community Center. The center is in the design and feasibility stage and leaders are currently applying for city landmark status. The boiler update is complete. The Green Lake Advisory Council is advocating for $5,000,000 to complete design and permitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guests-for-future-meetings"&gt;Guests for Future Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked if we could consider having a guest from Bellwether Housing present at the next meeting. Lindsey added that a guest from the Aurora Reimagined Coalition would be good also. Lindsey will reach out to Bellwether and Melanie will reach out to Aurora Commons for a contact at Aurora Reimagined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="north-precinct-report"&gt;North Precinct Report&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike gave an update on a few matters related to the North Precinct. He said crimes are up in the north end, particularly robberies and assault. There was a discussion about theft of catalytic converters on cars, based on stories attendees had heard from other areas. Mike is going to ask for any information on this at the next North Precinct update meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a question of whether prostitution is happening at a higher level right now. Mike pointed out that this is, in many cases, human trafficking. Melanie asked if the issue would be worth reaching out to City Council about to see what the city is doing to address this. Bekah mentioned that with the upcoming hot summer, it would be great for residents to share water and extra masks with sex workers on Aurora if they see a need. Janice Holkup said Aurora Commons provides services to folks in the area but that their long-time Executive Director is leaving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licton-springs-park-activity"&gt;Licton Springs Park Activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community member Nina asked what the best course of action is if there is suspicious or dangerous activity going on in the park (for example, a resident of the park burning plastic materials). Liz suggested using the Find It Fix It app and also calling the fire department, as they are familiar with the person who is doing this. Nina asked if background checks are ever conducted for folks living in the park given proximity to kids. Kathleen talked about her positive experience with SPD’s community service officer - this is different from typical police activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="new-licton-springs-park-signage"&gt;New Licton Springs Park Signage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matt Remle is planning a celebration to dedicate new Licton Springs park signage later this summer and the council will likely be invited to attend (but not have a speaking role). There will be a rock etching installed leading to the spring head. Liz will talk to Matt about particulars and get back to us. There was a discussion about gift giving at the event, as this is important in many indigenous cultures. Community member attendee Nina has a friend who may be able to provide insight on appropriate gifts. Lindsey will connect with Nina separately on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="halloween-event"&gt;Halloween Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen asked about whether the council would like to start planning a Halloween event. Other board members agreed that waiting until September to take the temperature on the pandemic situation, etc. would be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meeting-format"&gt;Meeting Format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lindsey inquired as to whether the council would be open to discussing in-person meetings again. Other members agreed it would be fine to table until the September meeting, but one option is to have quarterly meetings in person and others would be virtual, as it’s easier for many people to attend this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="halloween-celebration"&gt;Halloween Celebration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a discussion about a potential Halloween event but the topic was informally tabled as it’s several months away and the COVID-19 situation could be different then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="housing-in-licton-springs"&gt;Housing in Licton Springs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a discussion about rising housing prices and how they will affect Licton Springs residents. Melanie mentioned the Community Land Trust, which is an organization that buys property in various ways for the purpose of providing housing to people like teachers, police, firefighters, and other essential workers who may not be able to purchase or rent a home at market rate in the area. She encouraged attendees to refer people with affordability concerns to the Community Land Trust. Janice Holkup mentioned there will be another tiny house village going up in north Seattle soon.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minutes were approved. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janice Holkup shared information from Rep. Javier Valdez’ email newsletter outlining funding for the 46th district in the final state budget. This included $500,000 for the Aurora Commons acquisition, $150,000 to fund art by BIPOC artists at the Kraken training center, $30,519,000 for the North Seattle College library building renovation, $1,880,000 for library improvement grants, and $2,000,000 for the UW Medical Center NW behavioral health renovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob Blade talked about Aurora Reimagined, a new coalition that seeks to provide input in the city’s planning efforts around Highway 99. Melanie added that the city is at the conceptual level in planning right now and that it’s time to throw out broad, big ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The treasurer’s report was approved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates to ongoing committee and council work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSCC BANK ISSUE: Liz talked about the issue of removing Jan Brucker as a signer for LSCC’s bank account at Verity since she is no longer part of the council. As treasurer, Liz said her priority is to have new signers who are easy to get in touch with. She noted the bank would need a copy of the minutes indicating who LSCC directors voted in as new signers, and then she could help initiate paperwork. The directors voted unanimously to approve a motion to remove Jan Brucker as a signer on the LSCC Verity checking account. There was some discussion about the appropriate number of new signers. The directors voted to approve a motion to allow four signers, the voted to add Lindsey Webb and Melanie Davies as signers on LSCC’s Verity checking account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AURORA REIMAGINED COALITION: Melanie talked further about the Aurora Reimagined Coalition (website: www.got99problems.org) A large part of the city’s work on Aurora will be design guidelines related to pedestrian access, turn lanes, crossings, etc. The group meets once per month and will be holding revisioning workshops in July and August. Neighborhood residents can sign up on the website for updates. ALUV will likely be involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NORTHGATE LIGHT RAIL UPDATE: Melanie told the group that the pedestrian bridge between North Seattle College and the Northgate Link Light Rail station will be in place by the end of June. (Project link: http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bridges-stairs-and-other-structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NORTH POLICE PRECINCT UPDATE: Melanie talked about a series of dialogues the Seattle Police Department North Precinct will be hosting. These will be an opportunity to talk more deeply about the police department and the community. Three dialogues will take place in each of the five precincts, including some in Licton Springs. Interested residents can sign up here: https://seattleux.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSU8pPfHcc0tRY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PRECINCT REPORT: Mike gave a precinct report. At the last meeting, hosts went over each new state law related to policing. Governor Inslee has signed all but two. One new law establishes a duty for officers to intervene and report. The hosts of the meeting talked about the encampment at the part being cleaned up. On the first Wednesday of the month, social workers went to the site to let people know they would need to leave. There had been some incidents that led to the decision to clear the park. Car theft and homicides are up recently in general, but crime is down locally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BELLWEATHER HOUSING: Lindsey will be sending out a link to a survey Bellwether housing is conducting related to their future housing project and long house at North Seattle College. They are looking for community input on the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LISTSERV DISCUSSION: There was a discussion about outreach and information sharing via the listserv on the Licton Springs hotmail account. Attendees agreed that less is more when it comes to using the hotmail account for sharing information. However, there was some discussion about increasing outreach via social media like Facebook and Instagram. The directors voted to create a Licton Springs Instagram account. Lindsey volunteered to manage the account. She will also add Bekah as an admin on the Licton Springs Neighborhood account and remove Janice Lichtenwaldt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Planning&lt;/strong&gt;
- MUSIC IN THE PARK: There was a discussion about a music in the park event. Lindsey has been in email conversation with Boundless NW about an event over the summer. Dianne Trani asked about the cost of such an event. Lindsey said the council paid musicians ~$150 each for last year’s event.
- HALLOWEEN EVENTS: There was a discussion about a potential Halloween event but the topic was informally tabled as it’s several months away and the COVID-19 situation could be different then. Bob will get in touch with Casey at Epic Life Church for an update on what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These meeting minutes were approved at the January 2021 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Liz Kearns, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Dianne Trani, Tracy Cramer, Mike Cuadra, Emma Medicine White Crow, Bekah Manikowski (Gautrowski) and Matt, Peter Reid, Becky Edmonds, Jenny Frankl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Oct 21, 2020 were approved as circulated.  Treasurer’s Report was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of interest from Visitors: Jenny Frankl of SPU Clean Cities Litter Abatement shared information on litter route for Licton Springs. (attached).  Liz noted a work party upcoming Dec. 12 for Licton Springs Park with volnteers from Blanchet H.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becky Edmonds made a presentation on Restricted Parking Zone and other parking issues in Licton Springs area. (study map below). If the RPZ is expanded (there is an existing one due to NSCollege) with upcoming transportation changes, cost is $65/year for two year cycle.  Low income people have an option of paying $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny discussed the litter abatement program that started in 2017 in the city and in 2018 in Licton Springs-Aurora area.  A contractor is paid to cover Aurora between 84th and 105th.  Parks Dept deals with parks so that is not part of their program.  The volume of calls has not increased, but the volume of litter picked up has. The public cans along Aurora havea four times/week pick up for garbage and three times per week for recycling. Tracy suggested using free form at bottom of Find It Fix It app for special pickups for neighbors who voluntarily pick up litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board elections for 2021 were discussed. Our usual schedule for elections had been postponed last spring due to pandemic.  Nominations are due in March.  Let Kathleen know if Board members are interested in serving again.  She will construct a recruitment statement for Dianne Trani from jet City Apts. to sed to residents to try to get representaiton from renters in neighborhood.  Everyone wil try to recruit people, with an eye toward more divesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are unable to do holiday party and Epic Life Church is not planning lights in Licton Springs Park this year but Ellen noted there will b e a tree on the Burke cul-de-sac&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Dianne Trani, Tracy Cramer, Osbaldo Hernandez&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Sept 21, 2020 were approved as circulated.  Treasurer’s Reports was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1, Group discussed letter from ALUV sent to Geoffrey Wendtland January of this year to Office of Planning and Community Development. Ryan DiRaimo had emailed it to LSCC October 7 to keep us informed. It appears many planning projects are on hold due to disruptions caused by current COVID 19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSCC and UNEA/Clear Sky relations and purchase of tee-shirts to thank the UNEA youth.  melanie has already received orders and M/S/A to spend up to $500 for the shirts.  Liz attended the Sept 30 UNEA virtual meeting and noted once the pandemic is over, there might be volunteer opportunities with UNEA, for example, tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie invited visitors to address us. Tracy Cramer Clean City Division City of Seattle discussed community cleanup efforts, such as one for November, ate TBD. She also introduced us to Jenny Frankl, Sr Planning &amp;amp; Development Specialist Public Place Littering &amp;amp; Recycling Program, Clean City Division. Tracy and the group discussed clean up in the parks and neighborhood, particularly given recent City decisions on homeless encampmens.  Liz noted the Parks Dept would be doing a cleanup in Licton Springs Park Oct 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne Trani attended and noted her boss, Brian Robinson, a local property owner with various rental properties and a commitment to affordable housing and helping on neighborhood issues, would love to hear from LSCC on ways he could be of assistance.  Lindsey requested some help contacting renters who might be interested in joining us to add a diverse voice to the Council and help with outreach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osbaldo Hernandez from DON has replaced the retired Thomas Whittemore and introduced himself. He noted that community conversations has been initiated, with the next scheduled for Nov 18, probably on the topic of public safety. http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/outreach-and-engagement/community-conversations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several LSCC members attended the recent virtual town hall  held by Debra Juarez and reported on the budget presentation, looking on our screens at the Powerpoint slides (Ben Noble, Dean Allsopp) indicating some real shortfalls in revenue to the City that are necessitating putting many activities on hold, such as moving ahead for now with the feasibility study for an Aurora-Licton Community Center. Melanie also reported on the group discussing public safety (Indian Health Board and Community Police Commission, Esther Lucero and Ryan Gilbert) and Jason Johnson for City Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group considered a request from Board member Amanda Crosley for support for North Seattle College Co-Op Preschool (see Oct 19 email from Amanda). The Board authorized a $150 donation and Janice will get in touch with Amanda and request preference for the donation to go to local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice is still following up with Restricted Parking issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We affirmed that we cannot hold our holiday event this year due to the pandemic and city restrictions on parks since we usually hold it in Mineral Springs Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we plan to have an event to celebrate Jan Brucker’s years of service once we are able to hold events in person, for now, Kathleen and Ellen will deliver the recognition award to Jan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie reported on a Greenways meeting re Healthy Streets and Healthy Blocks initiatives and indicated there is still lack of clarity on all processes to designate streets or blocks as such. Healthy Streets are ones that had already been designated as Greenways but the blocks process not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Janice Holkup, Fadi Saloum, Mike Cuadra, Bekah Manikowski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of July 15, 2020 were approved as circulated. Treasurer’s Reports for July and through Sept.
12, 2020 were approved. Ellen also noted she filed our required yearly report with Wa State Sec. of
State’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion of purchasing tee-shirts for One Sky youth as a donation: The cost for eleven tee shirts
would be approx.. $262. This organization has had to move from Eagle Staff School to north Seattle
College and several Board members are in touch with leaders of the organization, including Sarah
Sense-Wilson. Council decided to reach out to Sarah and ascertain what program needs are and if the tee
shirts would be a welcome donation. The group weighted the symbolic importance of the shirts due to
their design using the indigenous language vs uncertainty about the needs of One Sky. It was also
M/S/A to invite Sarah to a future Council meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Kearns provided a great set of updates to various neighborhood issues (attached below) and thank
you also to Lee Bruch and Susan Ward for the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz also noted that the expansion of the North Precinct Police Station out- buildings and parking area is
now completed. The group then discussed the situation for people living without shelters in Licton
Springs park. Liz felt that there was a response to the letter the Council sent to get a cleanup initiated by
parks Dept employees. She noted there is still water there in the drinking fountain but the bathrooms are
locked and portable toilets provided. Several of the people there have received referrals to other housing
options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbor Bekah Manikowski, attending the meeting, has a social work background and shared her
thoughts on the situation in the park. She is concerned about the health of the people there given the
unhealthy air quality indices at the present time due to forest fires in Northwest
.
Janice had initiated a conversation with Karina Wallace of the NGO “Facing Homelessness” and
Kathleen followed up with a phone conversation with Karina. She sent these links to the Council:
- To sign up/review orientation and Facing Homelessness opportunities :
https://facinghomelessness.volunteerhub.com/
-  The BLOCK Project : https://www.the-block-project.org/
- Facing Homelessness website : https://www.facinghomelessness.org/
- Facing Homelessness Facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/HomelessInSeattle/
Karina also offered to visit a future meeting or even to go to the park and talk with the people camping
there. She noted the organization does a sock drive, takes donations, and often sponsors cleanups. It
also is sponsoring the construction of DADUs (detached accessory dwelling units) and has an
orientation once a month. The organization especially likes to show images of unsheltered people and
tell their stories on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the changes to the Community Police teams and the moving of Officer David
Gordon out of the role he has held for many years. Kathleen will draft a thank you email to officer
Gordon that also notes that LSCC is following this issue with cc to North precinct captain, new police
chief, and Council Rep. Juarez. She will circulate a draft for approval. The vote was 5 yes and one
abstain to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted with regret that our usual Halloween event in Licton Springs Park will not be possible
this year due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and everyone agreed this was a sad, but wise,
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey gave a recap of the Music-in-the-Neighborhood event this summer that was a success. But we
also have some ideas on how to modify and improve it for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Cuadra expressed thanks for the Council’s letter regarding zoning and the Halcyon Mobile Home
park in North Seattle. Bekah Manikowski discussed the importance of a get-out-the-vote effort at the
local level and she will write up a short paragraph about it and send to Janice so we can post it to our
list-serv and other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice concluded the meeting and thanked everyone. Next meeting will be by zoom Oct. 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADDENDUM (Thank you, Liz Kearns, for collecting this information)
STAY HEALTHY STREETS---Transportation/Seattle gov.
Here's the official city webpage on them:  http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-
programs/programs/stay-healthy-streets
From Lee Bruch:
It is an initiative in response to Covid that has been launched in many cities nationwide to give more
space for people out moving and exercising while maintaining 6 feet of social distance (where we have
sidewalks, most sidewalks are only 5 to 6 feet wide, not allowing people to pass while maintaining
social distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally, it was launched by Mayor Durkan and SDOT fairly quickly.  They specifically chose to launch it
on Greenways since those were already in place as slow traffic streets prioritizing pedestrians and
bikes over cars.  Here's an article when they were
launched:  https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2020/04/16/announcing-stay-healthy-streets/ .  Here's another
article talking more in-depth about pros and cons:  https://westseattleblog.com/2020/05/stay-healthy-
streets-explained-discussed-seattle-pedestrian-advisory-board/
Since that first announcement the network has gradually been expanded in response to public usage
and popularity.  The StayHealthy Streets program was for an indefinite length of time, roughly
estimated originally to last through Sept, or more recently, into October, depending on usage. I'm not
aware of any final date having been determined, but I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; the current intent may be to keep
them until towards the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayor and SDOT announced mid-summer that roughly 20 miles of them will be permanent. Which
20 miles is still being decided I believe, depending on results of various public surveys and traffic
counts SDOT has undertaken, results of some collision studies, city money issues, etc.
See  https://www.myballard.com/2020/05/08/seattle-to-make-20-miles-of-stay-healthy-streets-
permanent/
They are not closed to all traffic. They are meant to allow local traffic to serve the particular block, but
where pedestrians and bikes have the right-of-way (sort of like cul-de-sacs in suburban
neighborhoods).
Northgate Pedestrian &amp;amp; Bicycle Bridge---Transportation/Seattle.gov
Here is the link to Bridge information, and you can sign up on their mailing list for monthly or every
other month updates.

structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge
NG Ped/Bike Bridge cont.
What we’ve heard through design.
Based on community input throughout the project, we know there’s interest in:
Minimizing environmental impacts of the bridge by making sure, for example, that the project doesn’t
disturb wildlife during construction and ensuring the bridge’s drainage system (for stormwater) is
designed to enhance wetlands on the west end
Ensuring safety and security of all bridge travelers Wayfinding and traffic control The experience of
people biking and using other wheeled devices (e.g., scooters, wheelchairs, strollers, rollerblades,
suitcases, etc.)
Connecting the bridge to other infrastructure, including neighborhood bike routes
Separating or managing modes of traffic on the bridge
Other topics of interest included the project’s cost, the bridge’s durability, and maintaining vegetation.
Thank you Susan Ward for sending this link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIRE STATION #31
There is a land use sign at 1319 N Northgate Way saying it will be demolished.
An article in The Seattle Times 5.6.20 calls this building ‘The Cancer House’ and states the project
budget cost is $43M for design and construction of new Fire House.
The land use sign at Epic Life Church states their east parking lot will become a temporary Fire Station&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="31-with-tents-and-13-parking-spaces"&gt;31 with tents and 13 parking spaces.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle Times article (mentioned above) also states the City of Seattle will pay Epic Life Church
$10,000.00 a month for 5 years to lease this land.
Again, The Seattle Times article states the new site for FS#31 is 11302 Meridian Ave N
I drove by this address and there is no indication that anything is planned for this site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Minutes"/></entry><entry><title>Council Meeting Minutes July 2020</title><link href="https://lictonsprings.org/council-meeting-minutes-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-07-15T18:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-07-15T18:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Licton Springs Community Council</name></author><id>tag:lictonsprings.org,2020-07-15:/council-meeting-minutes-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A to have Kathleen draft a letter to Councilwoman Juarez expressing our concern about unavailability of public restrooms at Licton Springs Park due to campers’ items and presence blocking access. Kathleen will send a draft to LSCC members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A June 19, 2020 minutes as circulated.  There is no Treasurer’s Report for this period although Ellen did note a donation received. She will update us later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed producing tee-shirts via a print-on-demand company, Zazzle, recommended by Janice (https://www.zazzle.com/).  The group discussed design ideas and M/S/A to allocate funds to pay a designer recommended by Melanie. Janice okayed the idea with Tom Speer of UNEA in conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group continued planning on August 19 event to make use of City’s invitation to use some of Arts in the Park event money since the full event could not occur due to the current virus.  Thank you to Janice and Lindsey for doing much of the planning re outreach to secure musicians and indigenous artists.  John at the UPS Store at Oak Tree offered to give us a good rate on yard signs and flyers to publicize the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSCC received a request from John Lombard of D5 for support for a letter re zoning of the Halcyon Mobile Home Park to keep it available as a mobile home property.  The letter is still being constructed and M/S/A to authorize Janice and melanie to decide if LSCC can lend support for the letter once it is completed, since we do not meet in August. Melanie in particular would like to get more information from John and some of the model actions, such as Bothell’s, he referred to in portions of it drafted so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next meeting is in September. (16th) but it was decided to delay further Board member selection processes until 2021 because of anticipated ongoing restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our invitation, Susan ward of ReVisioning Northgate, attended and updated LSCC on activities around the Northgate area and actions taken by RN. She noted it was formed at grassroots level to advocate for green spaces and livable spaces and includes representatives from various on-profits as well as residents and businesses. The group discussed transportation issues, the underpass beneath I-5 at Northgate, METRO and its projects, including bus staging areas, parking impacts with impending light rail station, affordable housing, the tree code. The current pandemic has limited in-person meetings for the organization but it has been active in submitting commentary and letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of May 20, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through was approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then turned to having an activity that is community-oriented. Janice noted we were informed that while our arts in the Park project was on hold due to pandemic, the City did allocate $1600 to LSCC for any culture-related activity in the neighborhood, particularly promoting diversity and justice and combatting bias. Janice shared the email and offered by email and at the meeting a set of ideas on how to use the funds. (attachment) Janice will check with our partners at Clear Sky, Dianne train offered to look into musicians, and Melanie suggested we do tee-shirts. Lindsey and Janice will do some organizing on a possible event in August. The date of August 19 seemed most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was agreed we would touch base on whether to have a Board retreat in the fall, similar to the one we had Sept. of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then discussed the issue of recruiting a more diverse Board membership. Kathleen noted data from 2010 census that indicated Licton Springs is one of the more ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods north of the ship canal. (attachment) The group discussed the current climate for change, given local and national issues. Mehul weighed in about the need to do outreach to people who are not homeowners, perhaps leaving flyers near apartment buildings. Janice will provide the information about the local renters she met who were doing volunteer clean-up. Lindsey and Mehul offered to do a draft of a recruiting tool poster. Janice offered to write up a statement that could be posted on our web site and Facebook page. Kathleen, who is also a block watch captain, will contact North precinct officer David Gordo to see if there are any special instructions for people neighboring the precinct building and send it along to the Board if she receives any information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATTACHMENTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email from Janice June 12, 2020 to the Board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are receiving $1,600 to do something for the neighborhood to uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and/or cultural content. The requirements seem very loose. Given these funds were was originally ear-marked to celebrate the sacred indigenous status of Licton Springs I’d love to put some of the funds toward that AND we can do anything. Below is the start of a brainstorming list. Any other ideas? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire local artists to paint mail boxes in the neighborhood.  \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop, record, and host a podcast series, in partnership Clear    Sky, to celebrate the LS designation \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy colored chalk for the neighborhood to create their own sidewalk     murals. Take pictures and post on our Facebook and Instagram pages  and the blog \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring local artists to make chalk murals around the neighborhood \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring musicians to perform and stroll through the neighborhood on  different nights throughout the summer - bagpipes, saxophone,   trumpet, accordion, banjo, guitar \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Arts in Parks Partner,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your patience during these difficult and challenging times for our communities.  The work that many of you continue to do to support your community through all of this has been truly inspiring.  While we are no longer able to fund your originally proposed project in full, we are looking forward to working with you to support the work you are doing that benefits our community.  Seattle needs arts and culture now more than ever. We need you and the role you play in our sector’s ecosystem and in the civic life of our City as a whole. Even if the way you carry out your work has shifted, the value you provide cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWARD AMOUNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attached invoice is for $1,600 to support a public benefit in lieu of your original project and funding amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**HERE’S ALL YOU NEED TO DO:      **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respond &lt;/strong&gt;to this email to confirm that you have received it and with a brief description of the action or project that will take the place of your originally funded event and provides artistic or cultural public benefit (please see the backside of the attached invoice-report form for suggestions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be an action or project that is in the spirit of and supports the goals of the Arts in Parks program, of supporting under resourced communities within Seattle and supports the efforts of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://seattletogether.org/"&gt;Seattle Together&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and cultural    content&lt;/strong&gt; (digital and analog) to residents, especially     vulnerable populations, by resourcing artists, organizers and other     cultural partners.  \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate, support, and uplift mutual aid efforts&lt;/strong&gt; for     community resilience, efficacy and recovery driven by a dynamic     understanding of racial equity, neighborhood-level and cultural     community relationships, and digital technology access.   \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combatting bias/hate speech/harassment/violence&lt;/strong&gt; amidst  Covid-19, with an awareness of how this could have impacts on   surveillance and policing practices disproportionately impacting    BIPOC communities. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-scale projects are fine and if it aligns with work that you were planning on doing to benefit your community, even better. It can be something done via an email, online, virtually, through social media, or any other method of distribution that aligns with public health guidance for physical distancing. We’re not looking for you to spend significant time making something happen. We are hoping the prompts will inspire your imagination, be forward thinking and accessible.  At this time, these funds should not be planned to go towards a postponed in-person park event.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask that whatever action or project you do, to please include the tag #SeattleTogether and the City of Seattle logo found here: &lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo"&gt;http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo#tabs-5&lt;/a&gt; or provide written credit. (For example: “This project was supported by Arts in Parks, a partnership with Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Office of Arts &amp;amp; Culture.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete&lt;/strong&gt; an action that provides artistic or cultural public benefit.  Please email a link and/or promotional item/information about your project at least a week prior to it taking place so that we can help share it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submit your invoice and report&lt;/strong&gt;. Once your project is complete and available to the public, complete the attached invoice form and email it to &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;jenny.crooks@seattle.gov&lt;/span&gt; along with your brief narrative report. Please include a link of where to access your project or attach with your invoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;           We do need your signature on the form. If you don’t have a printer/scanner, you can save the invoice form as a pdf and use the attached instructions to sign it electronically.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may invoice anytime in 2020 through November 30, 2020 but we highly recommend doing so before &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;August 31, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once received, the City will send you payment. On average it can take 4 weeks for you to receive payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep us posted if either your primary contact or authorized signer changes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASSISTANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to answer any questions you have. If you need additional support, feel free to contact Jenny at &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Jenny.Crooks@seattle.gov&lt;/span&gt;.  If you would like to set-up a phone call to discuss possible projects, please include some windows of availability M-F 10am-4pm in your email.  If for some reason you feel like you are not able to complete an action or project associated with this funding, please reach out to discuss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With much appreciation, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Meeting minutes were approved at the June 2020 Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Janice Holkup …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Date/Time: May 20, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Meeting minutes were approved at the June 2020 Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Lindsey’s cats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:35. She welcomed everyone. Mike Cuadra introduced himself as a former Board member. There was a discussion of zoning and urban village boundaries. Melanie will reach out to ALUV to see if there is any news on zoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a discussion of progress at Northgate and the Board decided to invite Susan Ward to participate in our next meeting, June 17, by zoom, if she is available to update us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of April 15, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through May 20, 2020 was approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay Healthy Street Program- many signs are up to close streets off in our neighborhood for vehicle traffic, as is being done throughout the city, due to the pandemic and need to maintain social distancing while people are out exercising. Janice attempted to reach Debra Juarez about the question of neighborhood input if the closures re made permanent, but she did not hear back despite also copying in her staff. Liz talked about meeting a parking enforcement officer while she and Ellen were walking but that the officer had no information about the program. Melanie suggested talking to ALUV and Greenlake CC. We looked at the West Seattle blog website and noted that Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board and Greenways have been instrumental in the effort. The first public discussion did not occur until four weeks after the first closures were announced. Melanie and Janice will follow up. Lindsey suggested reaching out to Dan Strauss. Kathleen can contact Lee Bruch. Melanie will forward notes from Licton-Haller Greenways meeting (attached).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 7 Durkan virtual town hall- Janice and Melanie attended. Janice presented our question about budget implications for Licton Springs neighborhood. The bottom line is that funds will be scarce to non-existent for projects due to huge decrease in sales tax revenue during the pandemic and business closures. Melanie provided the links sent out from the town hall and they are attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz asked what sort of services we could offer to the community and noted she received a nice thank you letter from Washington Food Fund for our contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Seattle College- Janice is our rep. and she noted that Chemane Crawford is the new interim president. We discussed the location of future residence halls on their campus but noted that due to the pandemic, it was less likely the halls would be constructed in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts-in-the-Park- although we received a greenlight for next phase of our project recognizing Licton Springs park as sacred space to Native Americans, the funding is cancelled for now from the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen noted that the recruitment of people to an Advisory Board for the LSCC is put on hold until the fall due to the slowdown of activities with the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie reported on Seattle Arts Commission decision on temporary placements of art pieces that will be at either 92&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; or 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen noted that Mary Amberg was leaving the police dept to take a job in the private sector and she had sent an email thanking Mary for her service to our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board agreed that the June and July meetings should be held via Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Janice Holkup, Tracy Cramer, Thomas Whittemore, Noah An, Dan Strauss, Mehul Shah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of March 25, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 3/26 through 4/14/2020 was approved.  Ellen said the next report would reflect full amount received re brevity donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Council Representative from District 6, Dan Strauss, and his staff person, Noah An, attended.  The Council members thanked them for their time. Dan gave an overview of activities at his office during this time of COVID-19 contraction. He is holding meetings with constituents over the phone and continuing work on housing and transit issues.  He noted that Licton Springs borders both Districts 5 and 6 so he is available for inquiries from Licton Springs residents. Amanda asked him about the City Council work during the COVID-19 period and Dan explained that work continues, though at  a low level and there are lots of suggestions coming from the state government.  He noted the constraints on rents now and the strain on small businesses.  Melanie asked about his perspective on the community center plans for Licton Springs-Aurora and he noted he and Juarez are working cooperatively and he is following her lead on the issue. He noted that childcare is one of his priorities.  Kathleen asked about cooperative work among Strauss, Juarez, and Pedersen for North Seattle. Strauss reminded us that as a City Council rep. he is called upon to work on behalf of the whole city, not just District 6. He believes work on a new police station for the North Precinct should be coordinated- he recently did a “ride along” with North precinct staff. He concluded his visit by thanking Thomas Whittemore for delaying his retirement due to the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Haselnus of Seattle Neighborhood Group was not able to attend but sent in a proposal for a cooperative effort to do a street cleanup in the Licton Springs- Aurora area or at Mineral Springs park.  Tracy Cramer noted that last year, the group did an amazing job. She will contact Jordan about her idea.  The group agreed that litter cleanup is important, but prefer to wait until the governor’s stay at home order is lifted in May so as not to send the wrong signal, especially since the City has suspended its own clean up campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice and Tracy will write up a short piece about litter cleanup work for the Love Licton blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice and Kathleen noted that the Bloodmobile has been suspended for now and Bloodworks is booked into May for individual appointments. Kathleen sent out a plea for support of local foodbanks to our listserv, but has not yet gotten any responses. Lindsey noted the Washington Food Fund under the governor’s council and Philanthropy Northwest (&lt;a href="https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund"&gt;https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund&lt;/a&gt;). M/S/A for LSCC to donate $200 each to the Washington Food Fund and to Epic Life Church for their neighborhood food bank.  Kathleen will send Ellen the addresses so she can send paper checks to each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen reported on an effort to get North Precinct Block Watch captains organized for neighborhood self-help. Thomas Whittemore reported on the Seattle Together program by the City- it is a work in progress and will need guidance and approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the ReVisioning Northgate email  from Susan Ward on the rerouting of bus routes around the Northgate area.  Kathleen will forward her email to the Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council agreed to discuss in the future the prospect of having a credit card or a debit card for the Council’s bank account.  Ellen will report at the May meeting on the rider for Public Schools on our insurance coverage, due to be renewed in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice provided images of some tee-shirts and other swag souvenirs with the Licton Springs cattail logo that could be manufactured and sold on demand both to raise money and create neighborhood solidarity. The Council will proceed with this although it was noted we need to take care of the tax and potentially, business license, implications.  Melanie is going to check with a friend who does design about the logo.  Janice, melanie, and Lindsey will form a team to see if it is possible to launch this effort by May 2, which is Neighbor Day&lt;/p&gt;

Help was also offered to the Love Licton blog for material and Amanda and Tim are trying to keep it at very local level.  A lot of information is being pushed out right now by City, King County authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey and her husband, Mehul, are walking each street of Licton Springs neighborhood and will do a write-up and send Amanda.  Mehul is interested in LSCC eventually doing a community survey on loneliness and isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was noted that neighborhood restaurants are open for takeout and it is a good way to support business owners locally. Lindsey will follow up with Hector Martinez at Epic Life church who is with the local Buy Nothing group as well and see if something can be written up for the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz noted that the parks are closed so no work parties are now occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder that people should be filling out Census 2020 information.  Field operations have been moved till later due to virus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Holkup reminded people of Kathleen’s proposal that was on the table from the Feb 26 meeting.  She has attached it below for consideration at April meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice L. gave an update on Arts in the Park and that she has been in contact with Sarah Sense Wilson of Clear Sky.  The event will be pushed out to late August or Sept. in part to wait for City to do final approval of historic status for the park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominations for the Board and vote on approval will be moved to next September due to unusual circumstances of COVID 19 outbreak and to allow more time for recruiting new members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unapproved Minutes January 22, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascadia School Library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People introduced themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Nov. 20, 2019 were approved …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(unapproved)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unapproved Minutes January 22, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascadia School Library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People introduced themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Nov. 20, 2019 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 11-19-2019 through 1-15-2020 was approved.  Ellen noted that there was an additional deposit made and she would include it on the subsequent treasurer’s report. Amanda discussed her work with Randy Wiger on the proposal for the off-leash dog area at Mineral Springs Park. M/S/A that Licton Springs will contribute the value of Amanda’s work hours on this project for the future development of the proposal.  She estimates it as $100 thus far.   The group also discussed using the funds earmarked for Licton Springs Park, possibly for a summer event, with Liz’s approval because of her work as the forest steward for the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the designation of Licton Springs Park for historic status, given its significance to the Native American communities of the region.  The process is underway and has almost reached the last stage for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debora Juarez (referred to in these notes below as DJ) and her staff member, Shayna Daitch (SD), joined us (delayed due to police activity in downtown Seattle due to a shooting incident earlier). DJ discussed her understanding of the history of some issues associated with the Duwamish tribe and their designation. She said the Parks Dept .(Superintendent Jesús Aguirre) had informed her of the designation decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of a survey of Licton Springs area residents was discussed.  DJ had it with her as LSCC had sent the results ahead and distributed a summary on our listserv (attached below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ was asked to update the group on plans for a feasibility study of an Aurora-Licton Springs Community Center. She discussed the role of Jesús Aguirre and the Parks Dept. which will work with a community group to start the process.  $150,000 has been designated.  SD will be the point person staff contact.  DJ noted that the 6 year cycle for funding for Parks and Recreation is approaching and the feasibility study should be completed in a year.  She discussed her effort to secure the funding and the fact that the neighborhood is located in a “community center desert” in the City.  The PDOC (Park District Oversight Committee) is key to the process and once the 2020 census data comes in, that should help make the case.  DJ noted that this neighborhood has seen much growth of &lt;em&gt;families&lt;/em&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ then discussed all the activity occurring in District Five and how the Aurora, Northgate, and other neighborhoods are morphing into true family-oriented areas.  She talked about the need for sidewalks, a perennial problem in North Seattle. (note: residents from the Licton Springs neighborhood attended and asked her questions during the meeting so some of these notes are her responses to the questions). Subsequent to the 2019 general election, she has met with Council members Dan Strauss (District 6) and Alex Pedersen (District 4) to coordinate on issues impacting North Seattle and she is encouraged about how the representatives will work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She focused on infrastructure and development around Northgate and emphasized that much of the construction will be down with local union labor.  Newer low income housing will be constructed in the Northgate area and any current resident displaced will be able to move back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about plans for the North Precinct Police Station, DJ reviewed what was the impediment to earlier plans to build a new station. Plans are till underway and there will be community hearings at North Seattle College.  Lisa Herboldt is now chair of the committee that will deal with the issue and DJ is hopeful action will happen. DJ noted that the City is still handicapped by the insufficient number of police officers and we need to be attracting many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Webb asked about plans for a grocery store at Northgate and DJ said she is pleased with cooperation from Simon (major property owner) but City officials can only do so much where private property is involved. She has discussed, however, the demographics and character of the neighborhood and her preference for a union-shop grocery store to move into the new development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbors from Interlake Avenue asked about attention to development west of I-5, such as the need for a supermarket, and raised concern about the focus not being solely around the Northgate area. The group then discussed with DJ the need for attracting businesses along the Aurora corridor, including small enterprises, and reviewed pushback from Aurora Merchants to past efforts such as the moratorium and other work spearheaded by ALUV.  Again, DJ reiterated that where private property and a state highway (99) is involved, the City has a more limited role.  She discussed her efforts to work with Seattle Public Schools as the owner of the Oak Tree Village property, but that headway has not yet been made for any firm plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the work of ALUV and the new group, “For North” and that she has been attending some ALUV meetings and in contact with Casey Pier and there is hope to have a new phase of cooperation with business owners in the Aurora area. Amanda Crosley asked what LSCC can do to be helpful about encouraging business development, for example, with the west side of the upcoming pedestrian-bicycle bridge across I-5.  DJ noted the complications because of N Seattle College and University of Washington ownership of much of the land where the bridge ends up on the west side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge construction is coming up soon. SD noted that there is a need for letters of support for DJ who is calling for speeding up the Sound Transit plans for the 130&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; St light rail station to make it designed for a 2024 opening (to match Lynnwood link) rather than wait until 2031, which doesn’t make sense. SD will email Kathleen Braden with appropriate contact addresses to pass along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group was very happy to receive the news from DJ that the Home Zones projects are approved for money in the City budget.  In addition, SDOT has allocated $40,000 out of the regular SDOT budget for a Licton Springs Home Zone, a project supported earlier by LSCC, spearheaded by Amanda and Tim Crosley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group thanked Council Rep. Juarez and Shayna Daitch for attending and then proceeded with other business after they had to leave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resident Brigette Arden suggested that the survey done by LSCC be repeated on a regular basis to have a longitudinal record of responses and members of the LSCC Board agreed. The group discussed clean-up issues and problems with the 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Interlake area, especially associated with litter. Tracy Cramer, with Seattle Public Utilities and the person who deals with clean-up, attended and discussed how to report problem areas and the best way to send information to the City so that there can be a good response. She noted in particular the limitations the City or Public Utilities are under legally with respect to RVs and a 25 ft perimeter where crews are constrained about removals of trash. She took the information and said they will try to send out a crew to do cleanup on Stone Ave. N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda gave a report on the December 21 Mineral Springs holiday celebration and thanked everyone who participated. About fifty people attended despite the rain.  LSCC plans to do this event again in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen noted that we now have an electronic archive of the minutes dating back to the 1990s although there are some missing years from the mid-1990s.  It will be posted on the LSCC web site and can be searched using keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the upcoming grants workshop Jan. 25 at Bitter Lake if anyone wanted to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Braden noted the KIRO radio selection of Liz Kearns for their “Hometown hero” award in December.  Liz said she would be doing a work party for the park with second-graders from Cascadia School. Amanda reported on the Jan 20 tree plating at 85&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Meridian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Board members attended the January 5 Open House at North Seattle College on the I-5 Pedestrian-Bicycle Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen proposed that LSCC order more copies of the Licton Springs brochure and the item will be on the agenda for the Feb. 26 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATTACHMENT: 2019 Survey of Licton Springs Residents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survey ran from November 13th, 2019 to January 6th, 2020 and received 69 responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top themes included concerns over RVs in our neighborhood, state of the sidewalks (especially north of 100th), interest in additional retail / commerce. Many neighbors expressed thanks for the efforts of the community council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top issues for the neighborhood include safety &amp;amp; crime, cleanliness/litter control, need for a community center, and business development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of respondents are long term residents, living in Licton Springs for more than 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 29% of respondents had ever attended a LSCC meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook, Nextdoor, LSCC emails and LoveLicton are the main sources of information for the neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 respondents expressed interest in occasional service, 11 expressed interest in an advisory neighborhood group and 11 expressed interest in committees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top issues for the neighborhood include safety &amp;amp; crime, cleanliness/litter control, need for a community center, and business development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Minutes"/></entry><entry><title>Council Meeting Minutes January 2021</title><link href="https://lictonsprings.org/council-meeting-minutes-january-2021.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-01-17T18:30:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-01-17T18:30:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Licton Springs Community Council</name></author><id>tag:lictonsprings.org,2020-01-17:/council-meeting-minutes-january-2021.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting Date/Time: Jan. 27, 2021 6:30-8:30 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These meeting minutes were approved at the February 2021 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees: Dianne Trani, Mike Cuadra, Bekah and Matt Gautrowski, Osboldo Hernandez, Janice Holkup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Nov. 18, 2020 were approved as circulated.  Treasurer’s Report was approved and Ellen reported she filed our 990 form this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members: M/S/A to elect Bekah Gautrowski to fill the vacancy of Jan Brucker’s seat and Mike Cuadra to fill the vacancy of Tim Crosley’s seat.  According to the by-laws, this action places them on the Board immediately and then they agreed to be nominated for two-year seats with the March, 2021 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen updated regarding Board members and elections. The usual schedule has been interrupted due to the vagaries of the current COVID pandemic.  Here is the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms up in April: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Kathleen Braden, Ellen Beck, Lindsey Webb. All have agreed to stay on the Board and be nominated at the March meeting for a two-year term. Liz Kearns and Melanie Davies have been continuing even though their terms were up earlier and will be also nominated for a new term at the March meeting but their terms should go until 2022, not 2023, because we are late in confirming them and it is better not to have the whole Board’s terms end simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen agreed to be nominated to continue as Treasurer; Kathleen is stepping down as Secretary and Lindsey agreed to be nominated for that position. Janice is completing her time as President (and everyone agreed she has done a wonderful job for us) and Melanie is interested in the nomination for that spot.  We will need a nomination for Vice-President and Mike Cuadra might be willing to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Duties: Kathleen has stepped down as administrator for the Licton Springs Facebook Page.  Janice is still an administrator and will add Lindsey as one. Janice will also look into management of our website where minutes are posted and coordinate with Bekah &amp;amp; Matt who may be willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad-hoc committee on by-laws revision: M/S/A to create an ad-hoc committee that Bekah will head up to consider revision to our by-laws and Lindsey will also help spearhead. She plans to start with input from the Council and then invite participation by people in the Licton Springs Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homelessness: Melanie led a discussion to update on issues of unhoused populations in the neighborhood. The group discussed City policy, presence of campers in the park and at Green Lake.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parks: Liz Kearns sent in a note that work groups are being held in Mineral Springs and Licton Springs Parks, following proper protocols for pandemic safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business members: The Board agreed to ask Liz to congratulate Pilgrim Coffee which has moved into the Starbucks space at Oak Tree and invite as a business member of LSCC and to have Kathleen due likewise with Salt Blade Meats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janice started the meeting at 6:30. She asked people present to introduce themselves. Dianne Trani from jet City Property visited and Lindsey Webb who will soon be joining the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer’s Report of Oct 16-Nov 20 2019 and minutes from October 16 2019 were approved with correction of typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Events and applications&lt;/span&gt;: Amanda had completed the Arts in the Park application for a Dec. 21 event at Mineral Springs Park and LSCC was awarded the grant.  There will be a clothing drive, music, food, card making, and sugar plum elves. Entertainment and a port-a-potty will be provided and Amanda is currently in process of recruiting volunteers.  Kathleen will help Liz who is looking into finding another musician group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz noted the Dec 7 lighting for Licton Springs park and the lights will be up until Jan 11.  Epic Life Church will have a small ceremony to turn on the lights and Liz noted that special care will be taken for the safety of the light hangers.  Liz will send Kathleen an announcement to post and to ask for LED light donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group noted the summer movie program for Mineral Springs Park and the application that was submitted for a Native American celebration in Licton Springs Park in July (thank you Janice!).  We discussed whether we would need a business license from the City of Seattle and if it turns out we need it due to revenue amount, Janice will look into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie reported on Halloween event and had emailed Kathleen the cost and donations summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musicians                              $100.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candy                                   $171.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cider                                     $49.40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total                                     $320.65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations                             $203.77&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz reminded us of the second-Saturday work parties in Licton Springs Park and the group noted the press coverage of the Landmarks Preservation Board action regarding Native American significance of the park (reported in &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/span&gt; and Crosscut). Liz said there will be 3-4 work parties coming up for Mineral Springs Park and while there have been some rough campers there, tent campers have not been observed.  The disk golf people also plan some work parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Online vote results&lt;/span&gt;- the board voted by email to add the City of Seattle to our insurance coverage and to allocate $500 toward the matching grant portion of the application for the Native American summer celebration grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Other business&lt;/span&gt;- Amanda noted that the Parks Dept felt LSCC did not need a business license and will send Kathleen verification of that for the record.  She reported on our Paypal account to take donations and recommended transferring money to our bank account on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megan Hazen gave us addresses for parent groups from Cascadia and Eagle Staff schools and said that development of regular communication would be good between the PTAs and the LSCC: &lt;a href="mailto:communications@Cascadiapta.org"&gt;communications@Cascadiapta.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:info@eaglestaffptsa.org"&gt;info@eaglestaffptsa.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members thanked Janice for her organization and the room decorations to get us in a productive mood!  Various members brought in food and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice distributed documents including an agenda and time allocation for each item to keep us on track. She welcomed everyone and explained the plan for the retreat. Board members reviewed accomplishments for 2018-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members were then invited to state what they felt priorities should be for 2019-20 and Melanie Davies noted items on the whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then reviewed some operational guidelines for how the discussion would proceed.  Janice created a “Parking Lot” space for the whiteboard for items that occur to members but that we would park for subsequent discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group reviewed data on LSCC activities and some population profile data based on 1990 and 2010 Censuses to get an idea of distinctives of Licton Springs neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Beck gave a Treasurer’s report and the group discussed ideas on financial side (more fundraising, more equipment, more events, paying for a newsletter editor and distribution, grants to reflect our diverse community, Arts in the Park, visit-consult with Mark mendez of Lake City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice brought up the manner in which we take donations and payment of dues.  Amanda noted Amazon Smile and Janice and Ellen are going to verify that we are set for that  Kathleen will check on access to Paypal account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice noted her hope that we will create both a fundraising committee and a marketing-outreach committee and that we not miss the chance for some items we might sell such as tee shirts or bumper stickers. She noted such committees do not need to be just Board members but we could recruit members of the community who might be willing to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda discussed how we might use existing funds we have in our account.  Melanie noted the City’s fundraising workshops for community activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issues that were brought up included relations with schools in area, including North Seattle College, parking issue sin neighborhood, historic status of Licton Springs park and surrounding neighborhood, more on fundraising, and business relations, particularly with advent of NORA (North Aurora Business, a brainchild of Epic Life Church). Jan noted the passing of Faye Garneau and she will be sending a message of condolence on behalf of the council, pointing out Faye’s contribution to citizen activism as a business owner in the area.  Jan also underscored her interest that the Council start a system to have recognition of people/organizations who have made a positive impact on Licton Springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members then engaged in a prioritization process and various people agreed to be point people on the priorities as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice—School relations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz- Licton Springs historic status (park, neighborhood)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie- representing LSCC to other meetings and organizations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen &amp;amp; Thomas- Recruiting more Board members&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introductions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes Jan. 16 , 2019 were approved as distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter from Tim Motzer to Debora Juarez from Lake City Neighborhood Alliance (attached) asking for the Council's endorsement. Directors discussed it and had questions about the fee structure and asked Kathleen to send note to Tim declining but that we hope in the future to have a discussion on MHA and fees with other community groups such as LCNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As FYI, Kathleen provided map of MHA zooning proposals and list of amendments that are up for vote in March by City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion of Handy Andy business on Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda brought up Your Voice Your Choice request for proposals deadline approaching Feb 22 and the Neighborhood Street Fund program with votes due soon on proposals for Licton Springs and adjacent areas  Kathleen will send out to listserv remainder for people to go online and vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group discussed various techniques used by SDOT and DON that creates competition and even "popularity contests" among competing projects proposed by citizens.  Melanie suggested a letter about District Five being poorer than other districts in terms of sidewalks. Kathleen updated the group on proposal to improve signage in Licton Springs Park and her frustration with DON processes when this should merely be part of regular Parks maintenance schedule. She noted her intention to cease efforts to make a DON large grants proposal and will inform the d-hoc committee brought together in the fall, as well as PNA who had agreed to serve as sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda noted we did not get picked for the Arts in the Park projects and will explore other possibilities.  She will be looking into various grant options like Small Sparks and Neighborhood Matching Funds.  Kathleen suggested that any money LSCC had agreed to set aside from our parks fund for signage in Licton Springs Park might be redirected as matching seed money for the Arts or event projects Amanda is thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted that Epic Life Church might do another Celebrate North Seattle event. It might be good to invite someone from the church to our next meeting. She also discussed ALUV efforts to do a zoning change from commercial to neighborhood-commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the Home Zone project, SDOT, data on traffic measurement and Ed Irwin applying for speed bumps for traffic calming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted the Aurora pedestrian bridge artwork is now up and the daffodils planted there will soon be blooming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen noted that City Council District Five candidate John Lombard had indicated a desire to be at one of our meetings and the group noted he is welcome to come and listen but we have not had a tradition of inviting candidates in for their campaign promotions.  Kathleen will email him.&lt;/p&gt;

Emma also discussed the work at the schools and the hope to inspire and excite the children about tribal sovereignty of the land at Licton Springs park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Speer of Urban Native Education Alliance made a presentation, explaining as well his role as an elder and his concern for Licton Springs' historic significance. He noted that the Duwamish people have been in the area for 15,000years because tribal traditions date back to the Ice Age.  He stated that there were originally three springs at the park: Sulphur, iron oxide, and magnesium.  As of today, only the iron oxide spring is intact. He expressed dismay about the graffiti, needles, trash, excrement, and prostitution in the park. He also noted the significance of the park to the David Denny family and that David Denny, unlike other Dennys, had been a friend to local Native Americans.  Speer spoke for a group that is advocating for designation of the park as a historic landmark, with accompanying signage to explain the historic significance of the park. LSCC is requested to write a letter supporting the designation, as noted by both Thomas Speer and other visitors present such as Matt Remle, who provided a notebook of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma called for more money for education directly, rather than, for example, the money spent on the Andrew Morrison murals.  There was a general discussion about designation of historic places in Licton Springs area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen asked questions about the impact of a historic designation o the park management of the space and wants to be cautious about potentially negative interaction between City depts. that might inadvertently be harmful to use of the park.

&lt;p&gt;LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Minutes of June 20 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Directors Present&lt;/span&gt;:  Melanie Davies, Thomas Stachiw, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas convened the meeting at 6:40 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer's Report and minutes of May 16, 2018 were approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Culp presented an initial proposal to establish a dog off-leash area in Mineral Springs Park, following the City of Seattle guidelines for making a proposal (which Amanda and Tim Crosley distributed, along with a map of the park and location of other areas). Melanie suggested giving the Park Meridian residents a heads up. M/S/A that Licton Springs Community Council be a sponsoring organization to move ahead with the proposal to create an off-leash area in Mineral Springs Park per application process with Seattle Dept. of Parks &amp;amp; Recreation and include public outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Mary Amberg&lt;/span&gt;, Seattle Police Department Crime Prevention Coordinator made a presentation on neighborhood safety.  Mary explained her role, the role of David Gordon, community police team coordinator for our area, and the services they can provide. She showed a map explaining the boundaries and outlined the various issues David deals with in the neighborhood.  Visitors from the community asked questions with concerns about safety and police response when 911 Is called.  Mary explained the 911 prioritization system and noted that the police &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; respond but they might not come in person other than a drive-by survey unless a "request contact" phrase is used by caller to actually have an officer come to the door. Mary discussed the Navigation Tea, and outreach, cleanup of homeless camps, the use of the Find It-Fix It application, and the best way to report campers.  She reviewed the statistics for the N3 beat within the North Precinct where Licton Springs is located. She urged people not to leave &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; in cars because of car prowls. The current plan for the North Precinct building was discussed. She noted the LEAD program (Law Enforcement Aided Diversion) is coming to the precinct and officers are in training now. More officer shave been budgeted for patrols around the Aurora Encampment. She provided "Smart 911" cards from King County for people who might want their information to be recorded since there is currently not a way for an exact location to be tracked just from a cell phone. &lt;a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx"&gt;https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary noted that one can call the North Precinct and put in a "request to watch" for neighborhood or house and, provided the officer has time, it will be done on a regular basis.  She noted that King County keeps the sex registry and a map for the Licton Springs neighborhood can be seen online [https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/sheriff/sex-offender-search.aspx]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Licton Springs Web Page&lt;/span&gt;- Timothy showed us the proposed new web page for the Licton Springs Community Council which includes archived existing page.  He and Amanda had also scanned in old copies of &lt;em&gt;Currents&lt;/em&gt; and added a link, as well as a link to the North Precinct, things to do in the neighborhood, green space, discussion page, community calendar, and many other features.  The Licton Springs Community Council members complimented Tim &amp;amp; Amanda on it. M/S/A to commission Tim to go ahead with it and Kathleen will put him in contact with Lisa Henry to get codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Lee Bruch on Aurora Coalition, D5 plans-&lt;/span&gt; The May 31 forum sponsored by D5 with at-large City Council representatives went well, with about 150 people attending. In July, there will be vehicle-tours of District Five neighborhoods with Mosqueda and González over a two day period, July 27 (Northgate and Lake City) and July 31 (Licton Springs, Haller Lake, Bitter Lake).  Lee called for docents to help with the tour and make presentations at various stops, as well as assistance with handouts. Both ALUV and Licton Springs should participate. Jan suggested Liz for the park and discussed issues related to City Light land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then discussed concerns about plans for the North Precinct police station (portables, new parking area).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:40 PM.  Notes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas convened the meeting at 6:40 PM. People attending introduced themselves and explained issues they were interested in including park safety, cleanliness of neighborhood, school lighting, crime prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer's Report: Ellen noted a few items, such as the fact she paid the InMotion web hosting bill and filed the 99n from with the IRS and deposited two membership checks. The Treasurer's Report for April 1-30 2018 was approved as distributed. M/S/A the minutes of April 4, 2018 as distributed by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lou-Anne Daoust-Filiatrault from Seattle Public Utilities visited and presented information on an SPU pilot Litter Abatement Program.  Licton Springs will be the next neighborhood chosen for the program.  Two workers clean litter from Aurora Avenue and some nearby streets twice per week on Tuesdays and Fridays. Licton Springs was chosen as a result of the number of issues raised by residents to the City. The litter cleaning cannot be done in parks or on private property under this program. SPU also hopes to expand in the future the number of sharps disposal containers available since there are only eight city-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs and Mineral Springs Parks- Randy Wiger of City Parks &amp;amp; Recreation is holding two more public meetings, June 5 and July 3 and trying to get more people from disc golf community to attend.  Joseph reported on the recent work party in Licton Springs park. Kathleen noted the cordoning off around the restroom is due to roof and skylight repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A Kathleen will send a letter to Parks &amp;amp; Recreation Dept requesting that pet waste station be added to Licton Springs park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications task force: Joseph, Timothy, Tom Meyer, and Kathleen met May 8 and decided four points as recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that Licton Springs Community Council move its web outreach to the Love Licton blog managed by Tim and Amanda Crosley with the current Licton Springs Community Council website archived and still available via the blog.  Retain symbols for Licton Springs Community Council as cat-tail. Tim and Amanda will do a prototype that can be shown at June 20 meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to initiate a campaign to get out more knowledge throughout the neighborhood of Licton Springs Community Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make bulletin board in Licton Springs Park more prominent, perhaps move near restroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph is on sustainability committee for North Seattle College and will work with that group on community outreach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs Community Council approved having a table at Debora Juarez's Live in D5 event June 30. Melanie and Kathleen can provide labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Bruch presented information on a proposed Aurora Coalition and a draft of a letter to the City with information about safety concerns and steps for action had been circulated by email in draft form.  Lee is visiting different neighborhood groups to develop support for the coalition. Lee would like Licton Springs Community Council to join, to support the letter, and appoint a person to liaison with the coalition. After discussion, concern was raised that some missing Board members would want to vote on the request, so it is delayed until the June 20 meeting, but Thomas asked that an email discussion be generated among Board members. M/S/A meanwhile to authorize this statement for Lee with permission to use it: &lt;em&gt;The Licton Springs Community Council agrees with the conclusions raised by Lee Bruch on behalf of the Aurora Coalition and appreciates the proposed action steps in principle.  We will vote at our June 20, 2018 meeting on joining the coalition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the meeting then were invited to discuss some of their concerns and Lori Bienhoff discussed the lighting decision by Seattle Public Schools and the neighborhood meeting (which Melanie, Liz, Joseph also attended). The issue of access to the playfields at the Cascadia and RESMS schools was also discussed. Dissatisfaction was expressed that the School district would proceed with the lighting despite any opposition from the neighborhood. Lee Bruch offered materials from the (failed) attempt to get lighting controlled at Blanchet H.S. a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted that Mary Amberg of the Seattle Police Dept agreed to attend the Licton Springs Community Council June 20 meeting and Kathleen will make sure it is advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Crosley said she is very interested in helping with any community events and Kathleen will put her in touch with Jan Brucker who could not be here this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 PM.

Minutes of April 4 2018
Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133
Directors Present: Jan Brucker, Liz Kearns, Melanie Davies, Tom Meyer, and Kathleen Braden.
Jan convened the meeting at 6:30 PM. People attending introduced themselves.
Dave Kunkel, who has done so much to preserve Pillings Pond and its waterfowl, visited and
made a brief report on the property. He noted the section with the pond has been a designated
wetland and requires much upkeep. The property sold recently for $650,000. Dave has been
feeding and caring for over 100 fowl, mainly wood ducks (see photo), many of which he has
raised. Dave reviewed the history of the property since several people had come to the
meeting to show interest in it. He noted the family that purchased the property has an interest
in ducks, but most likely will be renting out the house. Dave is continuing to manage the
property. Jan reviewed past efforts, particularly by Dave Barber and neighborhood groups to
keep it preserved. The Parks Dept. does not seem inclined to take it on. There was a
suggestion to revive Friends of Pillings Pond as in the past, there had been non-profit status
for a group with that name. A neighbor who was attending out of interest in the property,
indicated she might like to help with that effort. Kathleen will send her contact information for
others who have been involved in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Bruch made a presentation on Aurora Avenue and noted that it is a good
time to consider future improvements. Lee is hoping to create a coalition of
north end groups who have a stake in the corridor and has already approached
many neighborhood groups such as Haller Lake, Green lake, Bitter Lake,
Greenwood, ALUV. Part of the impetus came from a recent series of stories on KUOW radio
about the corridor. Lee has also been asked to write something for “The Urbanist”. The group
reviewed past efforts and asked Lee some questions about role of WSDOT, evolution of
thinking on the part of businesses along Aurora. A re-paving project will occur summer of
2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[secretary’s note: see list of District Five 2018 street and utility projects at D5 Projects 2018]
Spring event- Melanie noted ALUV liked the idea of a garage sale event, perhaps for school
parking lots. Jan also presented information on the Seattle Symphonic Band at North Seattle
College. A possibility of music in the park and budget was briefly discussed in an
introductory, exploratory way (no details).
The Council noted the March 26 meeting on Licton Village low barrier encampment and an
interest in the community on crime rates. There was also an analysis on crime rates nearby
done on NextDoor. [secretary note- Draft Minutes Community Advisory Meeting March 22
2018]
The minutes of March 21 2018 were presented and Joseph had several corrections, so he will
send them to Kathleen and the minutes can be approved. The Treasurer’s Report of March
2018 was approved.
Vote on Board Members: Per Articles VII and VIII of the Licton Springs Community Council
By-Laws, the following people, having been nominated at the March 2018 meeting, were voted
on and approved for terms through April 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph Amann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellen Beck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan Brucker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie Davies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz Kearns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accord with Article VII-4 on filling a vacancy, the Board elected as a member Tim Crosley
and his term will run through April of 2018 as well.
M/S/Unanimous approval to thank Tom Meyer who has served for many years. Tom
indicate he will still be available to assist with improving communication for the Council.
Officers- elected by the Board are as follows:
Thomas Stachiw – President
Joseph Amann- Vice-President
Kathleen Braden – Secretary
Ellen Beck-Treasurer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Kearns gave an update on Licton Springs and Mineral Springs Parks, including how to
report campers in the parks to the City. The April 3 meeting with Randy Wiger of Parks Dept
on Mineral Springs Park had not been very well attended, possibly due to poor publicity.
There is a hope to get the disk golfing community more involved in future meetings.
Melanie Davies will contact Mary Amberg of Seattle Police Dept to see if she could attend a
June meeting on safety issues. Jan noted that we are lacking a representative to the Seattle
Police Advisory Committee and that Birgit Ardea might be interested in this service and Jan
will contact her about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 PM.
