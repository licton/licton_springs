<p>Meeting Date/Time: May 19 2021 6:30-8:00 P.M.</p>
<p>These meeting minutes were approved at the June 2021 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Notes</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Online meeting by Zoom due to Coronavirus restrictions</li>
<li>Directors present: Melanie Davies, Mike Cuadra, Kathleen Braden, Liz Kearns, Bekah Gautrowski, Bob Blade, Lindsey Webb</li>
<li>Attendees: Dianne Trani, Janice Holkup, Ellen Beck, Danielle Rosenow</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introductions, House-Keeping, and Reports from Visitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Melanie started the meeting and welcomed everyone at 6:35. </li>
<li>The minutes were approved. </li>
<li>Melanie asked for topics of discussion from attendees.</li>
<li>Janice Holkup shared information from Rep. Javier Valdez’ email newsletter outlining funding for the 46th district in the final state budget. This included $500,000 for the Aurora Commons acquisition, $150,000 to fund art by BIPOC artists at the Kraken training center, $30,519,000 for the North Seattle College library building renovation, $1,880,000 for library improvement grants, and $2,000,000 for the UW Medical Center NW behavioral health renovation.</li>
<li>Bob Blade talked about Aurora Reimagined, a new coalition that seeks to provide input in the city’s planning efforts around Highway 99. Melanie added that the city is at the conceptual level in planning right now and that it’s time to throw out broad, big ideas.</li>
<li>The treasurer’s report was approved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Updates to ongoing committee and council work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LSCC BANK ISSUE: Liz talked about the issue of removing Jan Brucker as a signer for LSCC’s bank account at Verity since she is no longer part of the council. As treasurer, Liz said her priority is to have new signers who are easy to get in touch with. She noted the bank would need a copy of the minutes indicating who LSCC directors voted in as new signers, and then she could help initiate paperwork. The directors voted unanimously to approve a motion to remove Jan Brucker as a signer on the LSCC Verity checking account. There was some discussion about the appropriate number of new signers. The directors voted to approve a motion to allow four signers, the voted to add Lindsey Webb and Melanie Davies as signers on LSCC’s Verity checking account.</li>
<li>AURORA REIMAGINED COALITION: Melanie talked further about the Aurora Reimagined Coalition (website: www.got99problems.org) A large part of the city’s work on Aurora will be design guidelines related to pedestrian access, turn lanes, crossings, etc. The group meets once per month and will be holding revisioning workshops in July and August. Neighborhood residents can sign up on the website for updates. ALUV will likely be involved.</li>
<li>NORTHGATE LIGHT RAIL UPDATE: Melanie told the group that the pedestrian bridge between North Seattle College and the Northgate Link Light Rail station will be in place by the end of June. (Project link: http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bridges-stairs-and-other-structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge)</li>
<li>NORTH POLICE PRECINCT UPDATE: Melanie talked about a series of dialogues the Seattle Police Department North Precinct will be hosting. These will be an opportunity to talk more deeply about the police department and the community. Three dialogues will take place in each of the five precincts, including some in Licton Springs. Interested residents can sign up here: https://seattleux.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9BSU8pPfHcc0tRY</li>
<li>PRECINCT REPORT: Mike gave a precinct report. At the last meeting, hosts went over each new state law related to policing. Governor Inslee has signed all but two. One new law establishes a duty for officers to intervene and report. The hosts of the meeting talked about the encampment at the part being cleaned up. On the first Wednesday of the month, social workers went to the site to let people know they would need to leave. There had been some incidents that led to the decision to clear the park. Car theft and homicides are up recently in general, but crime is down locally. </li>
<li>BELLWEATHER HOUSING: Lindsey will be sending out a link to a survey Bellwether housing is conducting related to their future housing project and long house at North Seattle College. They are looking for community input on the project.</li>
<li>LISTSERV DISCUSSION: There was a discussion about outreach and information sharing via the listserv on the Licton Springs hotmail account. Attendees agreed that less is more when it comes to using the hotmail account for sharing information. However, there was some discussion about increasing outreach via social media like Facebook and Instagram. The directors voted to create a Licton Springs Instagram account. Lindsey volunteered to manage the account. She will also add Bekah as an admin on the Licton Springs Neighborhood account and remove Janice Lichtenwaldt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Event Planning</strong>
- MUSIC IN THE PARK: There was a discussion about a music in the park event. Lindsey has been in email conversation with Boundless NW about an event over the summer. Dianne Trani asked about the cost of such an event. Lindsey said the council paid musicians ~$150 each for last year’s event.
- HALLOWEEN EVENTS: There was a discussion about a potential Halloween event but the topic was informally tabled as it’s several months away and the COVID-19 situation could be different then. Bob will get in touch with Casey at Epic Life Church for an update on what they’re doing.</p>

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Meeting Date/Time: Nov. 18, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>These meeting minutes were approved at the January 2021 meeting.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Liz Kearns, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Dianne Trani, Tracy Cramer, Mike Cuadra, Emma Medicine White Crow, Bekah Manikowski (Gautrowski) and Matt, Peter Reid, Becky Edmonds, Jenny Frankl</p>

<li>
<p>Issues of interest from Visitors: Jenny Frankl of SPU Clean Cities Litter Abatement shared information on litter route for Licton Springs. (attached).  Liz noted a work party upcoming Dec. 12 for Licton Springs Park with volnteers from Blanchet H.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky Edmonds made a presentation on Restricted Parking Zone and other parking issues in Licton Springs area. (study map below). If the RPZ is expanded (there is an existing one due to NSCollege) with upcoming transportation changes, cost is $65/year for two year cycle.  Low income people have an option of paying $10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenny discussed the litter abatement program that started in 2017 in the city and in 2018 in Licton Springs-Aurora area.  A contractor is paid to cover Aurora between 84th and 105th.  Parks Dept deals with parks so that is not part of their program.  The volume of calls has not increased, but the volume of litter picked up has. The public cans along Aurora havea four times/week pick up for garbage and three times per week for recycling. Tracy suggested using free form at bottom of Find It Fix It app for special pickups for neighbors who voluntarily pick up litter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board elections for 2021 were discussed. Our usual schedule for elections had been postponed last spring due to pandemic.  Nominations are due in March.  Let Kathleen know if Board members are interested in serving again.  She will construct a recruitment statement for Dianne Trani from jet City Apts. to sed to residents to try to get representaiton from renters in neighborhood.  Everyone wil try to recruit people, with an eye toward more divesity.</p>
